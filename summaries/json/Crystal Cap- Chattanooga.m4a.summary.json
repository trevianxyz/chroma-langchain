  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Crystal Cap from Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy teaches middle school computer science and leads the robotics team that participates in Vex VR programs. Her goals are to inspire students to become problem solvers, explore new careers through engineering design process, and implement STEM education with Vex. She feels a guidebook for first-year coaches would be helpful, along with an online platform for data tracking and progress assessment. Crystal enjoyed the conference but suggests more hands-on components next year. She shares a success story of her 6th grade students becoming confident problem solvers through the Vex Challenge competition. When asked about lesson failures or unengaged students, she had no major issues to report. Finally, she thanks Fireflies.ai for their survey participation opportunity and assures them that all information will remain confidential. "
