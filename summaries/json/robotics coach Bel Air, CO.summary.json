  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "A robotics coach with a background in IT and mechanical engineering discusses his involvement in the Bel Air Public School system's Vex robotics team. He hopes to expand the program at the school and provide more resources for non-educators on programming and mechanical engineering. One improvement he suggests is better communication from Vex, such as newsletters announcing new products and updates for coaches. He also mentions the importance of handling negative experiences in competitive robotics, but is unsure where feedback should go. "
