  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Chris Collins has been teaching robotics for 6 years, exclusively Vex IQ and plans to get into Vex Go. He wants to push Stem education into classrooms by providing more training and resources. Lack of resources is an obstacle in achieving his goals. Chris would like lesson plans with multiple disciplines, more information, and easier-to-use brains for the kids. He suggests having a program where educators can buy specific pieces rather than the entire kit. Chris has had success stories with students who appreciate him getting them started on their path of engineering or computer science careers. As he doesn't have lessons per se, there are no bad lessons to improve upon. "

  ],
  "Action items:": [
    "Follow-ups:",
    "1. What are Chris Collins' goals with STEM or computer science education?",
    "2. What are the impediments faced by Chris Collins in achieving his goals in STEM education?",
    "3. If Chris Collins could change one thing about either VEX or his STEM implementation, what would make his life easier as an educator?",
    "Action items:",
    "1. Provide more training and resources on VEX Go for Chris Collins.",
    "2. Create lesson plans that have multiple disciplines and subjects to help Chris Collins and other educators.",
    "3. Create a program that allows educators to buy new VEX parts without having to purchase an entire kit.",
    "4. Provide more information to get teachers excited about implementing STEM education in the classroom.",
    "5. Consider making the VEX Go kit more comprehensive by adding more pieces and supplemental parts.",
    "6. Consider reducing the amount of foam packaging in the VEX kit to make it more cost-effective.",
