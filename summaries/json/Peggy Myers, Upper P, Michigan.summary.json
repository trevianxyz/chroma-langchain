    "The middle schoolers and elementary schoolers use Vex IQ, while the high schoolers use Vex EXP.",
    "Their goals with STEM education include hosting a competition this upcoming October, having marketable skills for students, and changing the perception of what manufacturing looks like.",
    "They are working on professional development for their teachers and sent one teacher to a conference last year.",
    "Impediments to achieving their goals in STEM education include the distance to competitions and difficulty navigating the website.",
    "They suggest having a troubleshooting flowchart to help students.",
    "They allow for free build time and encourage creativity in the classroom.",
    "At their first competition, the team collaborations from other schools were the best part.",
