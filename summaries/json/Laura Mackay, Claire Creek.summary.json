  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Laura Mackay, the Coordinator of Innovative Programs at Claire Creek ISD, discusses her experience with Vex robotics and her goal to provide every K-5 student with a robotics experience during school hours. She identifies funding as an obstacle to reaching more schools and highlights the need for resources such as scratch cards to help students learn coding and sensors. Laura also suggests breaking sessions into groups for administrators and teachers and incorporating more curriculum tie-ins with science and math. Finally, she shares that hardware or software issues sometimes lead to unsuccessful lessons but overall has had success engaging all types of students in Vex Robotics. "
