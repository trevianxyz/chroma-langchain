  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Alcide Salse, representing the FDNY High School Robotics Club and Future Team, discusses their goals of expanding the team and incorporating Vex into his first responder STEAM program. The biggest impediment is time, but he praises the resources provided by Vex. He shares successes in engaging students in STEM programs through robotics and sees potential for growth with Vex products. He cannot share a terrible lesson or a group of unengaged students yet since they have not opened their V Five products, but predicts success based on student interest so far. "

  "Notes:": [
    "Alcide Salse is representing the New York City FDNY High School Robotics Club and Future Team, which is working with V Five kits and hopes to start a team to come to the VRCs double arrow.",
    "His goal is to expand the team and have multiple robots compete on a personal and private level, and to incorporate a lot of what Vex has to offer into the program that he's starting up with, which currently teaches young children about first responders and how technology and STEM are involved in all of their responses.",
    "The biggest hindrance to achieving these goals is time, both for accomplishing necessary knowledge and for the programs to grow themselves.",
    "There are no impediments to achieving these goals with Vex Robotics, as the Vex program provides videos, downloadable equipment from PDF files to rulers, and hands-on robots that make training a lot easier.",
    "The best thing that Alcide has experienced so far was the educational conference, which offered an endless supply of information and experience from all walks of life. He sees himself attending it year after year just to gain more and more knowledge.",
    "Alcide has seen students improve in their love for pursuing more in the STEM programs, especially with the robotics coming into fruition in the future. He thinks that once they start opening the boxes of all their V Five S, they're going to come in and start working on their designs, their engineering, their coding, and really pursuing the goal of coming to Texas for the finals.",
    "Alcide has not yet opened their V Five products, so he can't give an answer to the question of that one lesson with Vex that went terrible or that one student or group of students that he was not able to reach with Vex.",
    "Alcide predicts that he won't have difficulty with learning something new or being excited about robotics in general with the little that they've done so far and the interest that he's seen with the students."
