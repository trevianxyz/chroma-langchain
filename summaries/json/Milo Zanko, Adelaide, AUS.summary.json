  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Mill Zankov, a teacher in Adelaide, Australia has been involved with Vex since 2018 and teaches across all programs. He aims to scale the program and make it accessible to more students and schools. One of his biggest challenges is managing resources for extracurricular robotics programs in schools. He suggests having virtual support to show how classrooms can be set up with Vex equipment. Mill also shares a success story where students he taught qualified for Welds after starting with Vex in IQ, which showed their growth as a team. Additionally, he discusses an unsuccessful lesson on autonomous vehicles that did not excite his grade eight class as much as mechanics of robots did. "

    "2. Involvement with Vex (0:23-2:45). Mill Zankov discusses his involvement with Vex across all programs, including professional development and training for teachers.. He also talks about his work with One, Two, Three and Go for junior primary and primary teachers.. He mentions his role in running regional competitions for schools across sectors, government and non-government.",
    "3. Goals in Stem Education (2:46-4:20). Mill Zankov talks about his goals in scaling the Vex program to reach more students and schools.. He mentions his background in computer science teaching, and the need to focus on the mechanical engineering side for improvement.",
    "    ",
    "4. Challenges (4:21-6:08). Mill Zankov discusses the challenges of managing the resources and equipment for the extracurricular robotics program in his school.. He mentions the need for more resourcing and support for Australian schools that are new to the Vex program.",
    "    ",
    "5. Success Stories (6:09-8:05). Mill Zankov shares success stories of students who have participated in Vex competitions and have grown as a team.. He talks about how the Vex program has provided opportunities for students who may not have otherwise participated in robotics competitions.",
    "    ",
    "6. Lessons Learned (8:06-9:05). Mill Zankov talks about a lesson that didn't work out as planned when students were asked to build an IQ robot and run an autonomous challenge, but the excitement around autonomous vehicles was not there.",
    "Note: The timestamps are approximate and may vary based on the interpretation of the speaker's pause."

  "Notes:": [
    "Mill Zankov is a teacher in Adelaide, Australia who teaches Vex Robotics.",
    "He teaches computer science and professional development across R to twelve.",
    "He has been involved with all the programs.",
    "He has been doing professional development with One, Two, Three and Go for junior primary and primary teachers.",
    "He is interested in scaling the program to give more students and teachers access to Vex Robotics.",
    "He is looking to grow in the mechanical engineering side.",
    "He has a large extracurricular robotics program and has to manage resources in terms of classroom setup or workspace or workshop setup.",
    "He is looking for ways to get accessibility to high end teams or coaches or programs in the states that have been running for US international teams virtually.",
    "His success story is seeing the growth in students and seeing teams that otherwise would never participate in competitions like this through very minimal funding suddenly say they want to get involved.",
    "He learned that he moved too quickly to building an IQ robot and then running an autonomous challenge and saw that students were more interested in some of the mechanical componentry than the ethical and implications of autonomous vehicles on the roads."

  "Action items:": [
    "There are a few potential follow-ups and action items that can be inferred from the transcript:",
    "1. Follow-up on Mill Zankov's experience with Vex, especially as it relates to scaling the program and making it accessible to more students and teachers across Australia.",
    "2. Explore ways to provide more support and resources for schools that are just getting started with Vex, especially around setting up a workspace or workshop and managing equipment and materials.",
    "3. Explore ways to provide virtual support and training for teachers who are new to Vex, especially around mechanical engineering and CAD development.",
    "4. Consider ways to encourage high-end teams or coaches to share their expertise and experience virtually with other teachers and students who are new to the program.",
    "5. Learn more about Mill Zankov's experience with running an autonomous challenge in a grade eight class, and explore ways to tweak the lesson to better engage students and explore the ethical and practical implications of autonomous vehicles.",
    "These follow-ups and action items could be useful for anyone looking to improve the Vex program or get involved in STEM education in Australia."
