  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Bridget Myers, a teacher at Highland Park Middle School, discusses her goals for STEM education including increasing equity by getting more girls in the classroom and implementing standalone robotics classes for 7th and 8th graders. She also shares some impediments such as needing more resources to teach better day-to-day and wanting an easier way for students to code together on one hub. Bridget is interested in finding ways to use Vex IQ across multiple subjects and sharing success stories with other educators. She talks about how competitions within the classroom can be powerful tools for learning. Lastly, she shares that some students still struggle with coding despite exposure to robotics programs.",
    "The speaker reflects on their experience with VR and robotics, noting that they had focused too much on group size which led to student frustration. They suggest incorporating more coding before diving into robotics to help ease intimidation for some students. The speaker thanks the participants of a survey and assures confidentiality of their information for internal product improvement purposes. "
