  "Action items:": [
    "From the transcript, we can infer the following follow-ups and action items:",
    "1. The speaker, Tori Aldridge, mentions that they are in transition and trying to recruit more kids this year because they have not had a robotics program at their school. A potential follow-up question could be: \"What steps are you taking to recruit more students for the robotics program?\"",
    "2. Tori Aldridge mentions that they were able to get some extra funds to purchase Vex IQ sets, but they were only able to get two. A potential follow-up question could be: \"Are there any plans to purchase more Vex IQ sets in the future?\"",
    "3. Tori Aldridge mentions that they have about 45 6th grade students and 120 Level One students using the Vex IQ. A potential follow-up question could be: \"How are the students responding to using the Vex system for building robots?\"",
    "4. Tori Aldridge mentions that some equipment was missing or in disrepair when she took over the program. A potential action item could be to ensure that all equipment is in good working condition for the students to use.",
    "5. Tori Aldridge mentions that the Level Three students are taking a Code AP computer Science Principles course. A potential follow-up question could be: \"How are the Level Three students applying their knowledge to building robots using the Vex system?\"",
    "6. Tori Aldridge mentions that she wants to give the students a way to apply their knowledge with something that they can touch and feel. A potential action item could be to focus on providing hands-on activities for the students to engage with the Vex system and build robots."
