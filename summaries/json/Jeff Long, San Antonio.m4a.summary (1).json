  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Jeff Long, a teacher at Stevenson Middle School in San Antonio, Texas, shares information about himself and his teaching experience. He teaches STEM and Engineering courses using the Vex IQ system. Jeff is working on incorporating Vexpd into their learning management system (LMS), Schoology. His goals for STEM education include continuing with Vex IQ, participating in competitions, and potentially transitioning to the more advanced Vexr X or RQ systems. Funding and kit availability are impediments to achieving these goals. Jeff also highlights the challenge of transitioning students from block coding to Python coding. He suggests implementing a clear build series video for specific builds in PD Plus to make it easier for educators to understand instructions. Overall, he appreciates how Vex Robotics gets kids excited about robotics and engages them in learning while having fun. There have been no major failures with lessons but some issues with packaging convenience and losing small parts over time. "
