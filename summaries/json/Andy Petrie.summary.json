  "AI meeting summary:": [
    "Andy Petrie discusses efforts to involve more year levels in STEM, particularly through robotics, and suggests the need for more professional development in areas such as coding. He also requests a feature that links Vex Robotics to general curriculum subjects. Andy shares positive experiences with virtual programming and robotics but notes troubleshooting can be challenging. The transcript ends with an invitation for educators to share success stories and feedback on lessons or students they were not able to reach. "

  "Notes:": [
    "The school wants more year levels involved in STEM, like robotics, in the junior school.",
    "Andy Petrie wants more understanding behind coding and troubleshooting.",
    "It would be beneficial if Vex could show some links to robotics to general curriculum.",
    "Having the virtual ability to program and see robots move around really gives kids that kind of vision that they can actually do it and have a play around.",
    "The team from a school in Australia was able to articulate clearly exactly what they were trying to do and how they were trying to fix it, and were able to get through even though their robot didn't work for whatever reason.",
    "Troubleshooting and redirecting kids is probably the biggest challenge.",
    "There are not many times where something they've tried to do hasn't really worked.",
    "They will keep everything confidential and just want to use this for internal purposes to make their products better for educators."
  ],
  "Action items:": [
    "Based on the transcript, here are the follow-ups and action items:",
    "1. Get more year levels involved in STEM, particularly in robotics in the junior school.",
    "2. Provide professional development for educators, specifically on troubleshooting and coding.",
    "3. Show links between robotics and general curriculum, such as math and English.",
    "4. Improve the virtual ability to program and see robots move around.",
    "5. Fix any issues with connecting kids with Vex and iPads.",
    "6. Share success stories about Vex Robotics in classrooms, books, and competitions.",
    "7. Identify and address any lesson that didn't work out well and understand why.",
    "8. Help students redirect themselves in troubleshooting and problem-solving.",
    "9. Keep all survey information confidential and use it for internal purposes only.",
    "These follow-ups and action items can help improve the implementation of STEM education and Vex Robotics in schools."
