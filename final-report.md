# Survey of Educators
### VEX Educators Conference
##### Dallas, TX, April 2023

#### Respondants: 25 Educators & Coaches

 The perception of Vex VR is largely positive, with participants noting that the program is sufficient, that it is accessible to students with special education needs and those from poverty, and that it can be used across multiple curriculums.'

The most common challenges that all speakers have in common are a lack of resources for coaching non-educators on programming and mechanical engineering, the need for better communication and resources for coaching, and the challenges of getting teachers to understand that coding is not difficult and that there are resources available to help them integrate robotics into their curriculum.'

Respondents ask for information and mentorship on hosting competitions, troubleshooting flowcharts, classroom kits with spare parts, simplified interfaces, resources to help increase STEM skills among their workforce, and encouragement of collaboration among teams.

Teachers described transfer learning using Vex as having older students design or program a robot and then present it to younger students, allowing them to be the teacher and problem solver. This builds confidence and helps younger kids get invested in the process.'

The respondents ask for help with resources that make it easier to share their message about STEM education, and for packages that are ready to use and don't have to be pieced together. They also ask for help with troubleshooting and understanding coding and robotics.

Bernie Contreras expressed enthusiasm about the idea of students from his community engaging with robotics, engineering, and other STEM fields as potential career paths. He noted how the stories he heard at the Vex Educators Conference were hitting closer to home and had a more realistic connection. Speaker Valdez discussed the importance of financial resources for the district, the need for instructional technology, and the desire to bring people together over STEM and make it the future for the students. He was inspired by his experience at the Vex Educators Conference and hopes to get the top-down approach he is pushing for implemented in his district.'
