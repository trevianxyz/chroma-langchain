the packaging that you guys have, Vex IQ specifically in, is super tight.'}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""So it's like real convenient for storage, but for kids and for students to be using that packaging, I found that I have to put it into bigger bins so that way they can actually find the pieces.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""Because right now, especially on some of your connector pieces, the students, they'll spend 20 minutes looking this little box.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': 'I actually dump it into a larger bin so that way they can find the specific parts that they need.'}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': 'The other issue that we have found is students will sometimes lose little parts.'}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""And some of those are like, there's only two of those parts inside the box or three of those parts inside the box.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""Or if they lose one and they're trying to do some of these more advanced builds, all of a sudden, now we don't have the right parts to be able to do those more advanced builds because other students have lost them or done something with them that we can't find them.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""And usually we do a pretty good job of sweeping around the area to make sure that we don't pick up any of those parts.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text': ""But just the limitation if we're looking for, like, we need three pin connectors and there's only five pin connectors in the box, and you lose a couple of them, all of a sudden, after a couple of years, you've now not able to do that build anymore because the students have lost those parts.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Jeff Long', 'raw_text':

components right.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Milo Zankov', 'raw_text': ""So that's at a really small level, sorry, at more of a classroom level in terms of personally improvement, and then in a larger

at directly because it's just an assumed practice.""}, {'speaker_name': 'Milo Zankov', 'raw_text': ""But I think you got to remember from Australian schools getting into the program, they've never had

year or so to go before they finished school, they managed to qualify for Welds.'}, {'speaker_name': 'Milo Zankov', 'raw_text': 'And that was having those ups and downs throughout in terms of them

we do want to get involved.'}, {'speaker_name': 'Milo Zankov', 'raw_text': ""And so seeing that the school is able to provide the regional competition for teams to come and participate in that space
