0,So my goal with Stem education at.,Luis Chavez
1,This point would be to incorporate it.,Luis Chavez
2,Into the science lab.,Luis Chavez
3,"I currently see 3rd, fourth and fifth graders at my elementary school and they.",Luis Chavez
4,Come in for hands on science lessons.,Luis Chavez
5,And I see that this would be.,Luis Chavez
6,A great opportunity to make sure that NGSS standards are covered with the Vex program.,Luis Chavez
7,So that is what I am looking.,Luis Chavez
8,Forward to at this point and growing.,Luis Chavez
9,"In that area, as well as making.",Luis Chavez
10,Sure we are able to incorporate it.,Luis Chavez
11,School wide in the near future.,Luis Chavez
13,"Oh, yes.",Luis Chavez
14,"Luis Chavez, science teacher at Montague Charter Academy from Pacoima, California.",Luis Chavez
15,Cool.,
19,Have I started with Vex in 2019.,Luis Chavez
20,"Took a break and came back for this current season with Vex IQ, and we have had a couple of our teams actually qualify at the state.",Luis Chavez
22,14Th graders.,Luis Chavez
23,Cool.,
24,Awesome.,
25,One of the challenges so far would.,Luis Chavez
26,"Be the engineering notebook component and getting students more involved in that process, making sure we start that engineering design process correctly from the very beginning.",Luis Chavez
27,I would say that's what I need.,Luis Chavez
28,"More support on, as well as the teacher development component for the teachers at my school, because we do want to bring it back and expand on it across the grade levels.",Luis Chavez
29,So hopefully that's that's a great question.,Luis Chavez
30,What could what could we do to.,Luis Chavez
31,Make Becks a lot easier?,Luis Chavez
32,Maybe seeing some more hands on videos from teachers starting Vex as well as.,Luis Chavez
33,Videos of those students who are starting the process and then maybe relating some of the challenges that they have run into and sharing those with us.,Luis Chavez
34,One of my questions would be is.,Luis Chavez
35,"There a way to incorporate one, two, three Vex goal and IQ?",Luis Chavez
36,How to connect the three or how to gradually implement them from the lower grades all the way to the upper grades?,Luis Chavez
37,My success story or one of the successful moments for us definitely has been.,Luis Chavez
38,Seeing the level of parental involvement in.,Luis Chavez
39,Our program at our school.,Luis Chavez
40,"So that definitely has been one of the highlights for me doing Vex, seeing how involved parents become and how interested they become and the way that the.",Luis Chavez
41,Students explain it to them.,Luis Chavez
42,"It's so easy for them to accomplish that component, being able to explain the game to their family members.",Luis Chavez
43,I'm not sure that I've had an.,Luis Chavez
44,Experience like that just yet.,Luis Chavez
45,Everything has some sort of challenge.,Luis Chavez
46,I can't think of one particular one.,Luis Chavez
47,But definitely in regards to students wanting.,Luis Chavez
48,"To pursue careers, I can think of.",Luis Chavez
49,Two of our young students who are.,Luis Chavez
50,Looking forward to robotics and coding at the middle school level.,Luis Chavez
51,They come in during recess and lunch to put in the extra work.,Luis Chavez
52,So that definitely is very rewarding to.,Luis Chavez
53,See.,
55,And thank you.,Luis Chavez
0,I think what we're I think what we're trying to do at our school is to get more year levels involved in Stem.,Andy Petrie
1,"Certainly with the robotics, we've got year five and year three.",Andy Petrie
2,So we're just trying to spread that out a bit more in the junior school.,Andy Petrie
6,Andy Petrie.,Andy Petrie
7,Is that okay?,Andy Petrie
13,I definitely want to be able to get more understanding behind coding.,Andy Petrie
14,"I think I can code to a point, but then it's actually the troubleshooting that I struggle most with that would probably be more beneficial than just coding.",Andy Petrie
15,Yeah.,Andy Petrie
16,Troubleshooting working out what's gone wrong and how to fix it.,Andy Petrie
22,"I think if Vex could show some links to robotics to general curriculum, I know that it would be difficult to specifically target different countries and their specific curriculum, but if you could do a general, this could link to some English or this good link to some math, that would be really beneficial.",Andy Petrie
34,I think having the virtual ability to program and see these robots move around really gives the kids that kind of that vision that they can actually do it and have a play around.,Andy Petrie
35,And it doesn't matter if the robots are moving the right direction.,Andy Petrie
36,"I think I've had struggles with trying to connect kids with Vex and iPads in the past, but I'm not too sure if that's still an issue.",Andy Petrie
37,"So if that is an issue, that could be fixed.",Andy Petrie
38,"But generally speaking, there's a lot of great resources available to us from you guys.",Andy Petrie
39,So thank you.,Andy Petrie
44,"I'm extremely grateful to be here, and the only reason I'm here is because the team that came from the school that I'm from, they didn't win their area that they were in the national championships in Australia.",Andy Petrie
45,Their robot kept failing.,Andy Petrie
46,"The reason that they got through was because they were able to articulate clearly exactly what they were trying to do, how they were trying to fix it.",Andy Petrie
47,And it's a brilliant story to pass on to those children who and adults who think that you have to be uber successful at something to get to this sort of environment.,Andy Petrie
48,"They were brilliant, but their robot just didn't work for whatever reason, didn't do all it needed to do.",Andy Petrie
49,"But the reason they got here was because, as I said, they were able to explain everything that they were doing and just kept persisting, showed resilience, and I think it's a fantastic story.",Andy Petrie
63,I'm lucky enough to work with some people that are able to think on their feet and work through issues as they come up.,Andy Petrie
64,And I can't really think of many times where something we've tried to do hasn't really worked.,Andy Petrie
65,Probably the main problem would be referring back to a previous answer would be the Troubleshoot.,Andy Petrie
66,And it's just like what to know how to help the kids get them to redirect themselves is probably the biggest challenge.,Andy Petrie
67,I think that's probably the most suitable answer I have for you there.,Andy Petrie
73,Hold on Mike.,Andy Petrie
0,So my name is Mill Zankov.,Milo Zankov
1,"I'm teaching in Adelaide, Australia.",Milo Zankov
2,"I started with Vex in 2018 when Vex, Australia opened up a branch and warehouse and headquarters in in Adelaide.",Milo Zankov
3,And so my involvement is as a teacher across predominantly middle to high school in terms of the classroom setting.,Milo Zankov
4,But then I have role in terms of professional development across R to twelve and then I do some work with university sectors in terms of training preservice teachers.,Milo Zankov
5,And so my involvement with X has been across all the programs.,Milo Zankov
6,"Just recently I've been doing professional development with One, Two, Three and Go for our junior primary and primary teachers and then within the upper years teaching both in the classroom and then training some new staff as well.",Milo Zankov
7,"In the competitive side with the program it's been diverse because obviously we as the first school in the state to really start Vex and then run the regional competitions, there's been a lot of professional development on the competitive side for schools around the state and that's across sectors.",Milo Zankov
8,"So government, non government schools.",Milo Zankov
9,So my goals in Stem education are to continue growing the diversity of students and schools that are within the Vex program.,Milo Zankov
10,"Because for me, we had in the Adelaide region as an example, 16 schools involved bid over 400 students, which is a fantastic number in the state.",Milo Zankov
11,But that equally means that there are thousands of students that have not had an opportunity and hundreds of teachers and equally schools as well.,Milo Zankov
12,So for me it's about scaling the program and that's a big component.,Milo Zankov
13,"I guess I'm more thinking on a macro level now because within my school I've managed to get that golden, I guess, drive within teachers internally now in both computer science and the program where I could leave the school and it survives.",Milo Zankov
14,And so now I start to think about how can I ensure that there's a lot more students in the state that get access to the program and equally help those teachers and other programs nationally that can make sure that Vex keeps growing.,Milo Zankov
15,So I guess personally my background is in computer science teaching and that's what I've been doing for 15 plus years.,Milo Zankov
16,That area that Vex is covering in terms of the professional development side is very good in terms of teaching other teachers how to program and put that together.,Milo Zankov
17,So I feel like that's covered.,Milo Zankov
18,"But an area for me that is continually, I guess, something that I look to grow in is the mechanical engineering side.",Milo Zankov
19,"And so I feel like in some ways the computer science environment professionally the development has hit, it's never going to hit maturity, but it's very good and the components of that are excellent.",Milo Zankov
20,"And so it's this, I guess, be it with virtual support in terms of ensuring that there's CAD development and training for teachers like myself, that wasn't our background, but then equally as well skill sets around ensuring that we get the mechanical engineering components right.",Milo Zankov
21,"So that's at a really small level, sorry, at more of a classroom level in terms of personally improvement, and then in a larger area, it's always that space of ensuring that competition support exists and grows as the program in our state.",Milo Zankov
22,"As an example, moving out of just having 16 schools will probably double that this year.",Milo Zankov
23,All that remains and continues.,Milo Zankov
24,it.,
25,So an area that I think a lot of teachers when they get to a program as large as mine in terms of the extracurricular program.,Milo Zankov
26,"So even though we've only got 150 students, we're probably the largest school in the state in terms of an extracurricular robotics program.",Milo Zankov
27,"It sounds silly, but it's definitely something that teachers ask me a lot in Adelaide, Australia, around, is management of those resources in terms of classroom setup or workspace or workshop setup.",Milo Zankov
28,That is a continual area that is always growing.,Milo Zankov
29,"And so you can have schools that potentially are often introducing these parts, pieces, materials for the very first time.",Milo Zankov
30,"They might have traditional woodwork, metalwork, et cetera, but the actual setup of that environment is something that is often not discussed, it's found and stumbled upon, and you work it out as suddenly you've gone from five boxes off robots equipment to 25, 30.",Milo Zankov
31,And so I feel like that's a component of parts materials warehouse that is assumed that you'll just be able to do and understand.,Milo Zankov
32,But it's actually one of my biggest challenges now as I've gathered an enormous amount of resources of equipment over the years since 2018 that I've now dealing with.,Milo Zankov
33,And that's an important component because we have many more students now wanting to access those resources from the gone are the days of 30 students in the program.,Milo Zankov
34,So that's an area to look at.,Milo Zankov
35,You.,
36,I think the accessibility to high end teams or coaches or programs in the states that have been running for US international teams is very important and might be an area to really encourage and set up virtually and to have those conversations.,Milo Zankov
37,"So what my blue sky thinking around that space is I met a couple of teachers at Welds, and they took photos of how their massive setups or their robotic setups occur.",Milo Zankov
38,That I guess in a PD plus sense would be interesting.,Milo Zankov
39,"And I'm just brainstorming now, let's say if you had time zone or virtual time zone setups for something like, how do you deal with 100 kilos worth of Vex equipment in your classroom?",Milo Zankov
40,"Then if there was an opportunity to virtually come in via Google meets or whatever it was, to have a live conversation for ten minutes where that person on the other end is in their room in their environment, they're showing me their set up.",Milo Zankov
41,"They're showing me from the storage of how they're doing things like sea channels, et cetera.",Milo Zankov
42,And where are they being placed and in their room.,Milo Zankov
43,And giving me a tour.,Milo Zankov
44,And I'm able to ask them questions about how that functions for me at a level where the program in my school is obviously bursting at the seams in terms of the parts and pieces and materials.,Milo Zankov
45,"Like I said in the previous question, that can sometimes be, I guess, not looked at directly because it's just an assumed practice.",Milo Zankov
46,"But I think you got to remember from Australian schools getting into the program, they've never had this amount of equipment and set up, and so they don't have access to, I guess, in the States, many, many thousands of tens of thousands of schools involved in the program who they naturally can just almost drive to a school and go, show me how you've set it up.",Milo Zankov
47,We don't have that.,Milo Zankov
48,And it's very early days still in Australia in that space.,Milo Zankov
49,So we need more of that resourcing and support that decide.,Milo Zankov
50,"And I think that's important because if you can do that, you encourage people knowing how to handle Vex in terms of the parts and pieces, because if we don't, well, then we'll always kind of limit it based on how much resourcing a school is willing to sort of give someone in terms of cupboard space.",Milo Zankov
51,"Whereas if you can show them this is accessible for everyone, this is how we do it, then you have continual growth.",Milo Zankov
52,"So thank you very much, Jason and the team.",Milo Zankov
53,Yeah.,
54,Is this a summary?,Milo Zankov
55,Is this him finishing up?,Milo Zankov
56,There might be one more question.,Milo Zankov
57,It might be maybe one more so.,Milo Zankov
58,"Success story for me is just seeing the fact that we've had students this year, my full so come full cycle.",Milo Zankov
59,"So they started when Vex came to Australia in 2018 in IQ, and just with only a year or so to go before they finished school, they managed to qualify for Welds.",Milo Zankov
60,And that was having those ups and downs throughout in terms of them building and growing as a team and all those other components was amazing to see.,Milo Zankov
61,"I mean, for me, I've always said to them that it's just the growth in them that's the rewarding experience, and they know that as well.",Milo Zankov
62,"But to have that, I guess, added element of achieving an opportunity to see other teams from around the world who are the best of the best for the season was just the icing on the cake.",Milo Zankov
63,And I think that's been amazing.,Milo Zankov
64,"And from the other side of it is to have teams that otherwise would never participate in competitions like this through very minimal funding, suddenly say we do want to get involved.",Milo Zankov
65,"And so seeing that the school is able to provide the regional competition for teams to come and participate in that space and those students see that as their Welds tournament in a way, because they're just having an experience with other students that they never would of originally, I think that's just amazing.",Milo Zankov
66,"And so it can be a student seeing a small regional competition as their Worlds tournament all the way through to those students, knowing what Worlds was and is and then actually being here and seeing that has been amazing.",Milo Zankov
67,"So, thank you.",Milo Zankov
68,You it.,
69,"So I guess a lesson that perhaps didn't work out with Vex was moving too quickly to building an IQ robot and then running an autonomous challenge in terms of students programming or mimicking basically, what was happening in the industry with autonomous cars.",Milo Zankov
70,"I think what was interesting with that whole unit, which we're retweaking and changing, is the excitement around autonomous vehicles for students I perceived was going to be there, but it wasn't.",Milo Zankov
71,"And so they're more interested in some of the mechanical componentry in terms of how and functions a robot versus giving them an opportunity to explore the ethical and implications of autonomous vehicles on the roads, et cetera.",Milo Zankov
72,What I found in that particular grade eight class wasn't there.,Milo Zankov
73,"So when we changed tact and moved into some of the nuts and bolts off mechanics, off a robot, et cetera, and moved away from that, build a basic robot mover, et cetera, and think about the autonomy of what's happening yeah, that definitely is an area that when that lesson was happening, I thought, okay, there's some tweaks here to be made.",Milo Zankov
74,"So, yeah, that was one component.",Milo Zankov
0,I'm Peggy Myers.,Peggy Myers
1,"I am a middle school teacher, 6th through 8th grade at Hancock Middle School up in the Upper Peninsula of Michigan.",Peggy Myers
2,We use Vex from elementary all the way through high school.,Peggy Myers
3,The middle schoolers and elementary schoolers are using Vex IQ.,Peggy Myers
4,The high school is using vex EXP.,Peggy Myers
5,We and then was there another question on that one or not?,Peggy Myers
18,"We have a robotics program starting in elementary school, and it goes all the way through high school.",Peggy Myers
19,"We've done our first competition this year, but it was at the end of the season.",Peggy Myers
20,We had problems getting our Vex playing fields and some of our materials in on time for the kids to really be competitive for much of the season.,Peggy Myers
21,This year was definitely a learning season for us.,Peggy Myers
22,"Our goals with Becks are we'd like to host a competition this upcoming October, so we're looking for information and mentorship on that and then follow on goals.",Peggy Myers
23,"We would like our students to have marketable skills when they leave high school, some going on to college and some just getting employed straight out of high school.",Peggy Myers
24,"We've been talking to community leaders and manufacturers, other companies within our community, to see what skills they would like their workforce to have coming out of school.",Peggy Myers
25,"With robotics being such a high portion of manufacturing, we feel that's an important part of our important part of the curricula is that manufacturing tool and changing the perception of what manufacturing looks like from what it used to be to something that's more clean, more friendly to females in the workplace.",Peggy Myers
26,Lots of different things there.,Peggy Myers
27,The other thing that we're using Becks for is computer science and the coding aspect of it.,Peggy Myers
28,"So kids that want to go that direction, they've got a good platform with that.",Peggy Myers
29,"We found that the block coding, and it's a great tool.",Peggy Myers
30,"We've been starting our kids out on scratch to get them used to the coating before we started with Vex, and that loading real naturally.",Peggy Myers
37,We are working on professional development right now for our teachers so that we're up to speed on everything.,Peggy Myers
38,"I think we've got a pretty enthusiastic crew, so we're out looking for opportunities.",Peggy Myers
39,"We sent a teacher to this conference last year, so her experience, her team at the competition said much better than mine.",Peggy Myers
40,"This is my first time using Becks, and this is my first conference, and it's nice to see how everything goes.",Peggy Myers
41,"Just the format of everything and how the competition is run, how the teams are built.",Peggy Myers
42,"All the small details that you just absorb by seeing our challenges really are that we're located so far in the north of the Upper Peninsula that competitions are difficult for us to get to, logistically, being up in Hancock, Michigan.",Peggy Myers
43,So we would like to host a small competition up near us and maybe with some schools in Wisconsin.,Peggy Myers
44,Many of those are closer.,Peggy Myers
49,I think the website is difficult to navigate at times.,Peggy Myers
50,"There's a lot of information there, so I think all the information is there.",Peggy Myers
51,I think it's hard to find sometimes.,Peggy Myers
52,"There's a lot of marketing on the surface, and we have to dig through the marketing and the pitches to get through to what we're actually looking for.",Peggy Myers
53,"There have been some times when the kids are trying to troubleshoot when sensors aren't recognizing the right colors and things like that, and it's been hard for them to find short little troubleshooting for those types of things when they're trying to figure out why their controller is not working right or the sensors don't seem to be operating quite right.",Peggy Myers
54,There's not really a flow chart or a checklist to see.,Peggy Myers
55,"Hey, if this is going wrong, check first.",Peggy Myers
56,"If the sensor is not working right, what should they check first?",Peggy Myers
57,What should they check second?,Peggy Myers
58,Like a computational thinking kind of flowchart troubleshooting.,Peggy Myers
59,Troubleshooting flowchart would be really helpful for them.,Peggy Myers
70,"I think that when I allow my kids to do free build, how I've been using some of your labs and competitions is we start with that.",Peggy Myers
71,We get for that.,Peggy Myers
72,We use that as the basic bare bones.,Peggy Myers
73,And then I let them create their own competition.,Peggy Myers
74,They collaborate together at the board.,Peggy Myers
75,They make up their own rules.,Peggy Myers
76,They're allowed to use the playing field and manipulate the playing field how they would like to build their own classroom competition.,Peggy Myers
77,"So I think with the classroom kits, it would be cool if they had spare parts that they could use to go beyond the regular classroom kits.",Peggy Myers
78,I think that would be helpful too.,Peggy Myers
79,So we ended up with five.,Peggy Myers
80,"We bought five kits for our classrooms, for the regular labs, and then one competition kit.",Peggy Myers
81,I feel like that limited their creativity.,Peggy Myers
82,Having just one competition kit for class and the five regular standard kits spare parts would be great.,Peggy Myers
83,"And I'm just diving in now to some of the labs, having the kids do the different labs on the different gear ratios and things like that.",Peggy Myers
84,"So we're still learning a lot, but I think that's it.",Peggy Myers
85,Thanks.,Peggy Myers
86,Definitely one of my favorite parts about this job is it seemed like it was the last question all the time.,Peggy Myers
88,He got that everybody else like anything else question.,Peggy Myers
89,I'd assume it was last or a.,Peggy Myers
93,"Well, so we've only went to one competition so far.",Peggy Myers
94,The kids didn't.,Peggy Myers
95,"I mean, they competed, they had great attitude, but seeing that it was the end of the season, mostly their teams had their robots dialed in pretty well, and this was their first iteration.",Peggy Myers
96,"Like I said, we didn't get our playing field until after we had left for the competition.",Peggy Myers
97,So they didn't have any time to practice on the playing field at all before we went.,Peggy Myers
98,"I think that the best part that they took from it was that how the other team helped them out and collaborated with them and said, hey, I think you need this.",Peggy Myers
99,And they helped them help them make quick adjustments to the robot in between matches.,Peggy Myers
100,So the team collaborations from the other schools was probably the best part.,Peggy Myers
103,Don't be shy.,Peggy Myers
113,"Well, I don't have a typical answer for this one.",Peggy Myers
114,"The way that I structure the classroom, we don't follow a precise lab one, lab two, lab three, lab four.",Peggy Myers
115,I let the kids go in.,Peggy Myers
116,"I let them do some free build time, and then I show them what the competition is going to be, and I direct them to the instructional website, and they watch the videos and they build on their own.",Peggy Myers
117,"Usually, if they're coming up with problems, I redirect them back and point them to a group that's successful.",Peggy Myers
118,"So I guess I don't have a lesson that failed because I'm not teaching it in a traditional, teacher centered lesson environment.",Peggy Myers
119,It's all about the kids.,Peggy Myers
120,"And if the kids want to if the classroom goes off of the lesson plan, I let them.",Peggy Myers
121,It's an elective.,Peggy Myers
122,"I think that's kind of the point of all of this, is let the kids be creative, and the ideas that they come up with are going to be better than the ones that I was trying to direct them to.",Peggy Myers
128,We all right.,Peggy Myers
0,Okay.,Chris Collins
1,I'm Chris Collins.,Chris Collins
2,"I've been teaching robotics, or specifically Vex IQ for about six years, exclusively Vex IQ.",Chris Collins
3,"Next year, I'm going to get into the Vex Go, and most of my teaching career, I've been a fourth grade teacher, but this year was my first year as a GT specialist.",Chris Collins
4,"And so I'm excited about getting into the Vex Go, and even more excited getting one, two, three and trying to find ways that I can not just have it on me, but have it on the teachers to participate and to get this into their classrooms.",Chris Collins
5,"All right, next question.",
6,Thank you for information about yourself.,
7,Really appreciate that.,
8,What are your goals with Stem or computer science education?,
9,"Again, if you're just getting started with Vex or you've been doing Vex for a while, do you want to continue your program?",
10,Do you want to expand what you're doing with your program?,
11,"Maybe you're in the classroom, and you want to go to competitions, maybe doing competitions.",
12,"You want to go back in the classroom, or maybe you're just thinking about implementing Stem, and you want to implement Stem with that.",
13,Tell us what your goals are with Stem education.,
14,"My goals are to become more to do more of the go in the one, two, three, and to also push it into the classrooms.",Chris Collins
15,"I need more training on it, for sure.",Chris Collins
16,"And then once I've gotten the training and I feel very comfortable with it, I will try to push into teachers classes and help them implement it in the classroom using multiple parts of the curriculum, multiple subjects.",Chris Collins
17,"So that's my goal, to become a bigger Stem campus than we are right now.",Chris Collins
18,"Okay, great.",
19,"Now that we know what your goals are with Stem education, tell us what you feel some of the impediments might be.",
20,What is in the way of you achieving your goals in Stem education?,
21,Is it teacher training?,
22,Do you need more professional development?,
23,You need to learn more about something like Python coding or you want to be better at engineering?,
24,"What is it that you feel if you learned or you did or you received professional development on, or if we created a resource for you could really take what you are doing to the next level?",
25,"Well, definitely obstacle is resources, getting money to finance, getting more equipment.",Chris Collins
26,"There's only so much the district will supply me with, and it's a very slow process, and I'd like for it to be faster.",Chris Collins
27,I definitely would like more professional development.,Chris Collins
28,"And being here, I think being part of PD Plus finally, I think will help out a lot.",Chris Collins
29,"I'm going to use a lot of the resources for PD Plus online and try to use that to get better at coding, get better at engineering.",Chris Collins
30,"Until now, I've had a hard time trying to find out how to troubleshoot.",Chris Collins
31,I've kind of troubleshooted troubleshooting.,Chris Collins
32,"For the most part, it's trial and error.",Chris Collins
33,Why is this not working.,Chris Collins
34,"Well, let's try this.",Chris Collins
35,"And I'll sit there, and it takes up a lot of time when you don't know what you're doing, why the brain is acting this way.",Chris Collins
36,Why is this happening?,Chris Collins
37,Why isn't this working?,Chris Collins
38,Stuff like that.,Chris Collins
39,"And the programming, we've been very reluctant to do the autonomous part, the coding, because I just don't have that experience.",Chris Collins
40,Okay.,
41,This question is kind of related to the question I just asked.,
42,"If you could change one thing about either Vex or your Stem implementation, what would make your life easier as an educator, what could we provide for you that could really make what you're doing with Stem a lot easier than what you are currently doing right now?",
43,"Let us know that, please.",
44,We would love to be able to provide that for you.,
45,Lesson plans.,Chris Collins
46,And I know you all do have something like that online.,Chris Collins
47,"I haven't dabbled in it yet, but definitely lesson plans that have multiple disciplines, especially when you're pairing math and science together or reading and writing together, because that's usually how our teachers are blocked.",Chris Collins
48,A math teacher is not going to want to sit there and use it for one particular thing I see that the teachers want.,Chris Collins
49,How can we double dip?,Chris Collins
50,How can we kill two birds with 1 st?,Chris Collins
51,"So, more lessons, making the brains a little bit easier for the kids to deal with.",Chris Collins
52,I have all the old first generation of brains.,Chris Collins
53,We have 1 second generation.,Chris Collins
54,And I do see the difference in the interface on the brain.,Chris Collins
55,That is a big help.,Chris Collins
56,Further explanation.,Chris Collins
57,"Before I came to this convention, I did see that there are some videos explaining a few things here and there, some of the sensors and whatnot.",Chris Collins
58,That's good.,Chris Collins
59,"Just more information, more ways for me to get teachers in the classroom excited.",Chris Collins
60,I'm not a classroom teacher.,Chris Collins
61,I'm a teacher that I pull out and my kids and I teach robotics as an after school thing.,Chris Collins
62,That's one thing I need to know a little bit more about.,Chris Collins
63,"How am I going to do one, two, three, and go.",Chris Collins
64,Is it going to be after school thing?,Chris Collins
65,"I personally think it should be just woven into the curriculum, but we're working on that.",Chris Collins
66,"All right, thank you for information.",
67,That's wonderful.,
68,Is there anything else that you want to share with us?,
69,"Anything that you want to share with us that you think, again, would be valuable feedback that we can take with us back to our offices.",
70,"And again, use your feedback to make any of our platforms or Vex Code VR or Vex Professional plus that much better for you.",
71,So take this question again and just wax poetic about anything that you would like.,
72,Be honest with us.,
73,Be really honest.,
74,Don't be afraid to tell us that something that we have is terrible.,
75,"Be honest with us and let us know what it is that we can do to improve or if there is something that you really love, you can let us know that.",
76,Also.,
77,"I like for there to be a program to where you can I mean, I have kits, but they are older kits, and I'm missing little pieces here and there.",Chris Collins
78,I don't want to have to buy a whole giant set just to get new brains.,Chris Collins
79,"Or, you know, I would like I would like an option to where you can buy new pieces that you all may have that I won't have to buy a giant kit for.",Chris Collins
80,"I feel like Vex go, I've kind of dabbled a little bit with it.",Chris Collins
81,I haven't used it with kids yet.,Chris Collins
82,"Like I said, I just got it and I feel like there should be more parts to it.",Chris Collins
83,"More pieces, like maybe supplemental pieces that I could add.",Chris Collins
84,And maybe this is I don't know.,Chris Collins
85,"Like I said, I haven't tried it quite yet with kids.",Chris Collins
86,I'm still kind of playing around with it just to get a good feel of it.,Chris Collins
87,I don't understand why I need so much of a foam packaging.,Chris Collins
88,"I mean, it comes in pretty handy cases as it is.",Chris Collins
89,I feel like that money for the padded bags probably could have gone for maybe a cheaper kit.,Chris Collins
90,So I don't think the carrying cases are necessary.,Chris Collins
91,One of my favorite parts about this job is I get to travel the world and talk to educators all the time.,
92,And I love hearing about the success stories with Vex Robotics.,
93,"Whether it's a parent talking about how their student now is so much more engaged in school as a result of Vex, or a student talking about how much they love engineering now or how much they love computer science.",
94,"If you have any of those success stories, whether it's about competitions, classrooms, or books, we would love to hear that.",
95,So please share that with us.,
96,"Well, like I said, I've been teaching it for six years now, and I have had kids in my first group who are still doing robotics, and they have come back and told me that they appreciate me.",Chris Collins
97,It was me that got them started on the path that they are on.,Chris Collins
98,So that's definitely rewarding.,Chris Collins
99,It's great to hear that.,Chris Collins
100,I always love getting feedback from old students.,Chris Collins
101,"So to hear that, it's great, it's awesome.",Chris Collins
102,And hopefully I can expand our program and get more of those stories.,Chris Collins
103,"Okay, this is one of my favorite questions to ask educators.",
104,"And again, please be honest.",
105,Don't be shy.,
106,Tell me about that one lesson with facts that went terrible.,
107,Tell me about that one lesson.,
108,You couldn't wait to walk into school and teach this particular lesson and it just went bad.,
109,It fell flat.,
110,It didn't work out.,
111,For whatever reason.,
112,We would love to know why so we can fix that particular lesson.,
113,"Now, as a corollary to that, you can either conclude this or as an or let us know about that one student or that group of students that you were not able to reach with.",
114,"Becks you thought that after the exposure to your robotics club or to your classroom effect, that these students would want to go on and pursue engineering careers or computer science or just really kind of be engaged with it, but for whatever reason, it didn't work out.",
115,We would love to hear that.,
116,I don't really teach it as a lesson for Veg's IQ.,Chris Collins
117,It's more after school.,Chris Collins
118,We talk a little bit about the engineering notebook and the process you go through to create a robot.,Chris Collins
119,But I don't really have lessons.,Chris Collins
120,"I do find a lot of the kids, and I'm hoping that go in one, two, three will help this.",Chris Collins
121,"But when the kids come to me in fourth and fifth grade, they very clueless.",Chris Collins
122,"They'll come up with ideas that have nothing to do with the competition or that won't help, because they're still learning how to put the parts together and still kind of getting familiar with all of it.",Chris Collins
123,But I think that's why I was pushing for Vex Go so much.,Chris Collins
124,I was hoping that using Vex Go would help me get more qualified kids to go to IQ.,Chris Collins
125,Then they can go on from there into middle school.,Chris Collins
126,"So I don't really have any bad lessons, so I guess that's probably how I can't help with that one.",Chris Collins
127,So thank you very much for participating with our survey.,
128,"We, of course, are not going to share of your information with anyone.",
129,We will keep everything confidential.,
130,We just want to use this for our.,
0,Okay.,Laura Mackay
1,I'm Laura Mackay.,Laura Mackay
2,I'm from Claire Creek ISD I'm the coordinator of innovative Programs.,Laura Mackay
3,They just gave me a new title.,Laura Mackay
4,I've done competition robotics now probably for ten years.,Laura Mackay
5,"And then last year was when Claire Creek started the pilot program called the RCC, where we implemented Vex one, two, three, Vex Go and Vex IQ for pre K through fifth grade.",Laura Mackay
6,"So on the competition side, we've use the Vex IQ coding.",Laura Mackay
7,And then now we are using both the Vex Go and the Vex IQ coding pieces.,Laura Mackay
8,"And we do one, two, three.",Laura Mackay
9,"And we have just started coding one, two, three with our laptops with second graders, like, within the past six weeks.",Laura Mackay
10,So that is my experience with the coding piece of Vex.,Laura Mackay
22,So my goals with Stem education is I want robotics for all.,Laura Mackay
23,"I believe in the competition piece, but I could only reach 15 kids at a time.",Laura Mackay
24,"And so what I like with One, Two, Three, Go, and now IQ is that I'm trying to get all students 100% K through five having some kind of robotics experience during the school day, not after school.",Laura Mackay
25,And so we've been successful with that.,Laura Mackay
26,It's just finding time and finding the resources to pay for the robotics kits to keep rolling it out to more schools.,Laura Mackay
27,"So right now, we're in three schools, and more schools want to participate.",Laura Mackay
28,So now it's just a funding.,Laura Mackay
29,"But yes, if my goal is every kid in elementary school K through five would have some kind of robot experience a couple of times a year to get them comfortable with building and coding.",Laura Mackay
37,So the biggest impediment is money for resources for robotics is one piece.,Laura Mackay
38,"As I was sitting here listing in a session, I don't know if you know what scratch cards are.",Laura Mackay
39,"We use them with the MIT Scratch program, and they're cards kids can go get when they run into a problem, and it tells them how to do it.",Laura Mackay
40,"And so I'm looking at the LMS course, the person designed, where you could do maybe the bumpers, and you have to go through this LMS course.",Laura Mackay
41,"But I like the idea of a physical card that our kids could go pick up, and it would tell us, this is how you code a bumper, or this is how you code a sensor.",Laura Mackay
42,And it's right there.,Laura Mackay
43,A teacher doesn't really have to interact too much.,Laura Mackay
44,They physically get something coded and be done.,Laura Mackay
45,So those scratch parts have been awesome.,Laura Mackay
46,I need help on knowing the competition upgrade kit.,Laura Mackay
47,"There are several parts in there I have no clue how to use, nor how to teach them to our children.",Laura Mackay
48,And I haven't seen videos yet on how to do that.,Laura Mackay
49,"And I would also like to be that in person, not just watch a video, but actually physically go through that with someone.",Laura Mackay
50,"And I do think the videos are super helpful, but I also think my teachers are learning better when they're face to face with someone who's actually walking them through hands on.",Laura Mackay
51,"And so that's been a challenge, trying to find time to do that and trying to find people who can do that, basically almost on demand.",Laura Mackay
56,"Honestly, I think you provide a ton of support.",Laura Mackay
57,"So I think that's sort of a hard question because anything I need, a lot of it's already been created.",Laura Mackay
58,"So I guess I'm really looking for, specifically in Texas, ways to integrate to content.",Laura Mackay
59,"So you know that about me, and that would make my life easier if some of those things were already highlighted.",Laura Mackay
60,"Like, here's the standard, here's how it's met exactly with math.",Laura Mackay
61,But it also sort of takes away from my teacher's creativity if too many of that stuff is created because part of it is them creating it to feel like they're buying into robotics.,Laura Mackay
62,"So that and then the scratch cards, like how to use the sensors, how to use some of the harder things.",Laura Mackay
63,"And kids won't necessarily go watch a video, but maybe, like, the kind of elements to some we just sort of saw where I could maybe like it's already created in canvas, and I just copy it over to a teacher's course, and there's no work to be done.",Laura Mackay
64,It's just already pre created.,Laura Mackay
76,"I think next year for this conference, breaking us into two groups for a session or two where you're looking at administrators and then teachers and having it from the two different viewpoints.",Laura Mackay
77,"Lately we were having problems with the Vex one, two, three, puck with them, not holding a charge with them, not taking the code.",Laura Mackay
78,"They're a year old, so I don't know if that's it.",Laura Mackay
79,We traded out the batteries.,Laura Mackay
80,Some of them won't charge or update it's not on the software side.,Laura Mackay
81,But I need to investigate that more a little bit.,Laura Mackay
82,I'd like to see a couple more things with the base bots related to science and math and some more curriculum tie ins.,Laura Mackay
83,"But honestly, your Stem labs are amazing.",Laura Mackay
84,And then I guess I sort of think about what I do with Minecraft and Scratch.,Laura Mackay
85,They both have these built in tutorials where you do like this little piece and sort of code and find it.,Laura Mackay
86,I sort of feel like you all have that too.,Laura Mackay
87,"But that's sort of where our work is now that we've taught kids, is how can they teach themselves without us?",Laura Mackay
88,"And so making sure that that's super simple, which most of it I feel like it is, we can search anything and find a video on it.",Laura Mackay
89,"But yeah, Jason, you are doing a great job.",Laura Mackay
94,I think you have heard all of my success stories and you are is a revolution and we are on the ground floor.,Laura Mackay
95,And I think in about ten years we will have this integrated into content and will just be something that all kids do.,Laura Mackay
96,"They may not all love robotics, but at least all of them will have had a chance to try it.",Laura Mackay
97,"And so I feel like this is something that's going to be integrated into our public schools and just be part of, just a normal part of what we do, which I think is amazing.",Laura Mackay
109,We have not had that problem really in elementary.,Laura Mackay
110,Everyone who's done it has enjoyed it and been engaged with it.,Laura Mackay
111,"The issue is that might not be their thing, but that's a very small group of kids.",Laura Mackay
112,"Even our special ed kids, our low kids, our kids from poverty, they've all been able to do Vex and they've loved it.",Laura Mackay
113,"The issues right now, I'm not sure if you can fix it, and I need to look at it some more.",Laura Mackay
114,"But the lessons that went bad are the ones where something's glitching, where we have twelve Vex pucks and six of them aren't working even though we charged them overnight, or we can't, for whatever reason, get the code to download.",Laura Mackay
115,And part of that's probably some of it might be user error where we're not totally understanding what we're doing or we're doing something wrong.,Laura Mackay
116,"So before I want to say that's totally my answer, I need to go back and research a little bit to make sure I'm correct on that.",Laura Mackay
117,It's really a hardware issue or a software issue and not just a user error issue.,Laura Mackay
0,It's.,
1,My goals with Stem education are to bring these kids up to competition level and hopefully move this outside of the classroom where I can participate more with the Vex competitions myself on a personal level.,
2,"But again, this is starting from the ground up.",
3,So I am excited to see where we shall be in the next three to five years.,
4,"Well, currently all of the systems that you have in place in training for Vex is absolutely amazing.",
5,"Again, I will be probably looking to build my team.",
6,"So this year I'll be by myself, which will probably post something really big.",
7,"But once I learn everything that it is I need to learn, I would like to incorporate some more teachers and build this on a bigger scale.",
8,"And also what's most important, have rental buy in for the upcoming school year.",
9,"Currently I believe that you guys provide everything that is needed for the teacher or coordinator or Admin or anyone to be successful with Vex down to the professional development, plus videos, all the hands on training.",
10,"So at this point in time, I think you guys are doing an awesome and amazing joby.",
11,The one thing that I know that I'll probably need assistance with going forward is if I am asked to implement this across the Texas state standards.,
12,Though I know why you guys do have an overall pricing guide and things that we need.,
13,I would more so need help placing this across the subcurriculum.,
14,So that is what we are trying to work the Kinks out for the upcoming school year is what do they want it to look like?,
15,"Because this will basically be strictly a Stem class, but I would also like to incorporate to help the other teachers in regards to state testing.",
16,"Well, so when I first moved to Houston back in 2008, we were introduced to a program called Houston that a young lady had started in the city of Houston on the high school level.",
17,She did use the best robots.,
18,"I knew nothing about it, so as a new teacher, they said give it to the new girl.",
19,I took it and grabbed me a few future engineering students.,
20,ROTC students.,
21,"Our first year in competition, we placed 22nd.",
22,"Well, once the kids realized it and their brain started going, the next two years that I was in the district, we did play second place overall.",
23,So I will say that Vex is very good and I'm pleased to be working back with sex again.,
24,"Well, at this point in time, this question does not refer to me.",
25,"So hopefully by the end of next school year or for the next Vex Educators conference, once everything has been implemented, I will be able to provide you with that answer.",
26,Thank you so much.,
27,Cute.,
0,My name is Alcide Salse.,Alcide Salse
1,Al Salse from the New York City Fire Department.,Alcide Salse
2,I'm here representing the New York City FDNY High School.,Alcide Salse
3,We just started a club last September.,Alcide Salse
4,The club is slowly growing into what's going to be a future team.,Alcide Salse
5,"We are working with the V Five kits, and we're hoping to start a team to come to the VRCs double arrow.",Alcide Salse
16,"As the director of the FDNY High School Robotics Club and Future Team, I'm looking to hopefully expand the team and have multiple robots compete on a personal and private level.",Alcide Salse
17,"I have my own business where I will slowly incorporate a lot of the BECs one, two, three, the Go, and the IQ with my program, I currently teach young children about first responders and how technology and steam involved in all of our responses.",Alcide Salse
18,"And after attending the educational conferences, I realized that I can incorporate a lot of what Vex has to offer into the program that I'm starting up with.",Alcide Salse
26,"There really isn't much in the way the training obviously will occur as we continue to grow, both with the FDNY High School team and on my personal side with my business.",Alcide Salse
27,I think the biggest hindrance is time.,Alcide Salse
28,Right?,Alcide Salse
29,You need the time to be able to accomplish your set goals.,Alcide Salse
30,One thing I do enjoy about the Vex program as a whole are the fact that you already accomplished a lot of that time saving factor by providing the videos and the hands on that you can go along with the videos and the robots that you work with.,Alcide Salse
31,"The one, two, three, the Go, the IQ.",Alcide Salse
32,"I don't have any of those yet, but I can see already that the videos that you provided for those sets are going to make the training a lot easier.",Alcide Salse
33,So I guess right now it's just a matter of time.,Alcide Salse
34,"Both the time that we're going to have to put in to get up to speed with the necessary knowledge, but also the time needed for the programs to grow themselves.",Alcide Salse
40,"Unfortunately, I don't have a good answer to this question other than the fact that you've already covered all the bases with the Vex program.",Alcide Salse
41,"Again, I'll repeat, the videos are amazing.",Alcide Salse
42,"The downloadable equipment from the PDF files to the rulers, all those things just make it so much easier.",Alcide Salse
43,So I really don't have much to add to something that's already so good.,Alcide Salse
44,"And as we grow, maybe that'll change, but right now, you're providing everything we need.",Alcide Salse
56,I think the best thing that I've experienced so far was this educational conference.,Alcide Salse
57,I see myself attending it year after year just to gain more and more knowledge.,Alcide Salse
58,"The presentations that were offered were just an endless supply of information and experience from all walks of life, from the educational aspect to the personal experiences to the community based programs.",Alcide Salse
59,"And I think it's something that not only do I aspire to continue to come to, but I'm hoping somewhere down the road I can maybe come down and be a presenter if the program that we're looking to do is successful.",Alcide Salse
60,"And I feel that with the Vex program, it's going to be tenfold in the success aspect.",Alcide Salse
65,Two of the main successes that I've experienced so far.,Alcide Salse
66,"Again, we're just starting out a club at the high school with the intentions of starting a team is the fact that I've seen students not only improve in their love for pursuing more in the Stem programs, especially with the robotics coming into fruition in the future, but the fact that they're slowly bringing their friends along as well.",Alcide Salse
67,"We're an urban, inner city school with the usual problems that are found in that type of environment.",Alcide Salse
68,"And I can see a lot of these kids starting to see a brighter future by attending the club to the point where while I am personally doing some It work and just loading up things or charging batteries during the school time, students will skip lunch and actually come into the classroom and just do extra work on their own.",Alcide Salse
69,"Whether it's playing chess, whether it's coding.",Alcide Salse
70,"And I'm pretty sure once we start opening the boxes of all our V five S, they're going to come in and start working on their designs, their engineering, their coding, and really pursuing the goal of coming to Texas for the finals.",Alcide Salse
71,"On a personal note, with my business, I see myself, like I said, using the younger, aged, appropriate Vex products to expand what I thought was going to be more for the older kids.",Alcide Salse
72,"As a first responder steam enrichment and outreach program, I realized that using the younger age robotics, I can really implicate a lot of what I'm already teaching.",Alcide Salse
73,"One of the things that I've noticed, even though I'm not using Vex, I see the children really finding interest in learning something that they've already learned math and science, obviously, art, some engineering.",Alcide Salse
74,"But I see that when they come up to me and go, are you going to come back next week with a sense of I can't wait to see you again?",Alcide Salse
75,That I think is going to grow exponentially when I introduce the Vex programs that you guys offer.,Alcide Salse
85,"Unfortunately, I can't give an answer to that since we haven't opened our V Five products.",Alcide Salse
86,But I will make a prediction.,Alcide Salse
87,I don't see this happening.,Alcide Salse
88,"Unfortunately, with the little that we've done so far and the interest that I've seen with the students when these boxes are open and they see all the parts, all the components, and the fact that I've taken hundreds of videos and photographs of the World Championships, I think I predict that's going to be an impossible task of having someone have difficulty either with learning something new or being excited about robotics in general.",Alcide Salse
89,But to be continued.,Alcide Salse
90,I'll be back next year to answer this question.,Alcide Salse
96,Thank you for everything as well.,Alcide Salse
1,Hi.,Dallas Librarian
2,I am a librarian in Dallas ISD.,Dallas Librarian
3,My campus has fourth graders through 8th grade.,Dallas Librarian
4,"I am at a small school, and so my principal asked if I would teach the robotics class.",Dallas Librarian
5,"All the specialists in my school were asked to teach a sub project outside of their specialty, just because we're small and they needed offerings but don't have the ability to hire additional staff.",Dallas Librarian
6,"So this was my first year to teach middle school robotics elective, and we used Vex IQ, and it was a huge learning curve for me.",Dallas Librarian
17,"So, yes, in addition to teaching the Vex IQ robotics class, we also had a competition, two teams here in Dallas, IC, and we did go to competitions.",Dallas Librarian
18,"My goal as the librarian is to also purchase with funds that I have in the library, the Vex Go kits for my fourth and fifth grade class.",Dallas Librarian
19,And I've learned quite a bit here.,Dallas Librarian
20,"And I have a granddaughter who's in kinder and hope to purchase this summer the Vex one, two, three for her so she can start learning about coding and robotics.",Dallas Librarian
28,So I would love to have PD on how to navigate your website in your PD.,Dallas Librarian
29,"Plus, you have lots of resources.",Dallas Librarian
30,"So I'd like to have a session next year on just your website, the tabs where I go as an educator, that kind of thing.",Dallas Librarian
31,"And then in addition, because I'm a librarian, I also want some cross curricular lessons.",Dallas Librarian
32,How do we apply this?,Dallas Librarian
33,"What lessons do you have specifically for math and science, language arts, even social studies and history, in addition to the computer science lessons as well.",Dallas Librarian
34,"And again, I'm sure you have some of these things already in your website.",Dallas Librarian
35,Just navigating that would be helpful in what you have available.,Dallas Librarian
36,That's free to us as educators.,Dallas Librarian
42,"I do think that your conference, your educators conference, should be more about what can we do, what can we take back to our classroom?",Dallas Librarian
43,So we are not most of the people that are attending here are classroom teachers.,Dallas Librarian
44,We're not principals.,Dallas Librarian
45,"We're not over our Steam department, and we're not superintendent.",Dallas Librarian
46,"So while hearing from Chicago and Miami Dade about the programs they have and how they've implemented them, that doesn't help me as an educator.",Dallas Librarian
47,Take that back to my classroom.,Dallas Librarian
48,"It's interesting, and it's good to know.",Dallas Librarian
49,"And there are some resources that the AI guy provided, so I've taken some of that, and then the few other resource is I'm looking over my notes.",Dallas Librarian
50,"But that's basically what I am looking for, is also, in addition, grants.",Dallas Librarian
51,What grants are available that we can apply for so that we can fund some of these?,Dallas Librarian
52,As someone who works in Dallas ISD it's a huge district.,Dallas Librarian
53,"As a single educator, I can only influence my particular school.",Dallas Librarian
54,"So what grants are available that you know of, whether they're federal or in the state or in the computer science area that I could apply for to get more excess money funds to purchase more of the Mexico?",Dallas Librarian
65,"That also, I think you've done an excellent job of inspiring us as educators to invest in Vex Robots.",Dallas Librarian
66,"And the kits that you have, they are engaging, from what we can see, and just more information about your product, more ways about how we can engage our students, specifically in the classroom, and would love to know more about the Vex code VR that is also available and the coding there.",Dallas Librarian
71,I just hope in the future to have more success stories.,Dallas Librarian
72,I can only say that I appreciate your product and my learning curve has been enormous this year by being thrown into the classroom to teach this and just want to continue to grow as a librarian and learn even more about coding and robotics in the future for the benefit of my students.,Dallas Librarian
85,I guess the struggles that we had with Beck's IQ are some of the same ones that a lot of the kids or some of the presenters had shared where the controller was not connected to the brain.,Dallas Librarian
86,"Or for instance, I did a March Madness activity.",Dallas Librarian
87,"So they built a couple of basketball nets at other end, and then they had to code the robot to go throw the ball in there.",Dallas Librarian
88,"And each time they were asking it to drive forward, even though they would change the code to drive straight, make a 90 degree angle.",Dallas Librarian
89,Each time it went differently.,Dallas Librarian
90,"I don't know, for lack of a better word, it just didn't seem like it was the same every time.",Dallas Librarian
91,And so they got frustrated by that.,Dallas Librarian
92,But I'm not sure that there's anything you can do with that.,Dallas Librarian
93,"So frustration is definitely part of it, but it's also a growing and learning lesson.",Dallas Librarian
94,"And to be in the future, they will have to learn how to deal with failure.",Dallas Librarian
95,"Failure and frustration, both myself and the students.",Dallas Librarian
96,And then what can we do to make it better?,Dallas Librarian
97,How can we fix that problem?,Dallas Librarian
98,That would be the challenge.,Dallas Librarian
101,You're welcome.,Dallas Librarian
102,Really?,Dallas Librarian
2,My name is Jeff Long.,Jeff Long
3,"I teach at Stevenson Middle School down in San Antonio, Texas.",Jeff Long
4,I've been teaching for five years.,Jeff Long
5,"Prior to that, I was 24 years in the military as an army engineer.",Jeff Long
6,"Right now, I teach Stem and Engineering.",Jeff Long
7,"So I have a stem future lab course, and then I have a applied engineering course.",Jeff Long
8,That's where we teach the the Vex IQ.,Jeff Long
9,"Right now, we're doing Vex IQ you for about three weeks.",Jeff Long
10,So we're just looking at how do we incorporate the stuff from PD into our learning management system?,Jeff Long
11,And I am the only one in the district right now that's doing that.,Jeff Long
12,"So I'm taking the stuff from Vexpd and putting it into our LMS, which is schoology.",Jeff Long
13,And we're starting off with kind of Introduction to Robotics.,Jeff Long
14,Then we do Introduction to Coding.,Jeff Long
15,Then we go into the tractor pool.,Jeff Long
16,Then we go into gear ratio.,Jeff Long
17,Then we go into the Tug of War.,Jeff Long
18,"Then we do a forklift build, and then we do some forklift competition stuff with the kids.",Jeff Long
19,"And so really like, the system a lot of information kind of information overload when we go into PD and just learned about the Vex VR stuff.",Jeff Long
20,So that's going to be interesting to try to incorporate.,Jeff Long
21,"And that's going to kind of assist us with rolling out the IQ to some of these other schools, because one of our big challenges, of course funding and then the number of kits that we have.",Jeff Long
22,"So if you have anything over three students on a kit, they kind of lose interest a little bit, because really, it's like a two student kit.",Jeff Long
23,So just trying to get the kids keep the kid engaged while they're learning.,Jeff Long
24,The Vxvr is going to be really great on that.,Jeff Long
36,So our goals with Stem education is to kind of keep it on where we're at right now.,Jeff Long
37,So about three weeks for the Vex IQ.,Jeff Long
38,One of our other future goals is to try to get into the competitions.,Jeff Long
39,"And so if we could do it with Vex IQ, that would be okay.",Jeff Long
40,"But I kind of want to go with the Vexr X or RQ, the more advanced system that the high schools have.",Jeff Long
41,"Just trying to figure out how we're going to do that, how we're going to get the district to buy into.",Jeff Long
42,That is going to be the challenge.,Jeff Long
50,So I think one of the biggest issues is kind of the funding.,Jeff Long
51,"So just the number of kits that we have per student, like I had said before, another issue is how do you incorporate that transition from block coding to Python?",Jeff Long
52,"I find that especially at the level that we're at, middle school level, 8th graders, they have a lot of trouble kind of going from block coding to Python.",Jeff Long
53,And so I like the integration that you guys are doing with being able to do block coding first and then transitioning over to Python.,Jeff Long
54,But it's just a challenge to get the kids to learn how to implement the Python without losing interest.,Jeff Long
60,So I think the biggest thing would be how to implement it in an LMS.,Jeff Long
61,So kind of this is what three week program would look like.,Jeff Long
62,This is what a six week program this is what a nine week program would look like.,Jeff Long
63,"And just kind of giving the goals and we use Teaks, but the requirements per area.",Jeff Long
64,"And just saying this is like a basic Stem course, or this is a basic Vex course.",Jeff Long
65,"This is kind of more advanced and kind of outlining a little bit more, because right now, the problem with Vex PD that I have is it's a lot of information and just how to digest that information and then streamline it to what would fit our program.",Jeff Long
77,So I really do appreciate all the step by step instructions inside PD Plus.,Jeff Long
78,The lessons are good in PD plus.,Jeff Long
79,"One thing I would probably ask to add is add a build series on specific builds video, like a video build series, so that way we can see exactly which part you want us to use.",Jeff Long
80,"Sometimes it's hard to interpret based on the picture which part we're supposed to be using, or how it's supposed to line up, or even kind of which axle to use.",Jeff Long
81,Right?,Jeff Long
82,"So especially like when we do the gear ratio stuff, your pictures on the PD Plus are not clear on which axle to use and it doesn't really specify on this is the gear ratio for torque.",Jeff Long
83,This is the gear ratio for speed.,Jeff Long
84,This is the gear ratio for efficiency.,Jeff Long
85,So just expanding on those areas so that way the kids kind of can or the educators trying to use PD Plus don't have to kind of experiment for themselves and figure it out.,Jeff Long
86,"You guys are kind of putting it out there and saying, hey, this is exactly the builds that you need to have.",Jeff Long
91,So I think the biggest success story for Vex is just getting the kids excited about robotics.,Jeff Long
92,"Once the kids go into the different sections, they get introduced to the robot, they learn how to code.",Jeff Long
93,"And then once you introduce them to that controller, you just see a little light in their eyes, right?",Jeff Long
94,Because they think it's like an RC car.,Jeff Long
95,And so just giving them something fun and engaging.,Jeff Long
96,And sometimes they're learning and they may not even understand that they are learning just because of the fun factor with the project.,Jeff Long
108,So there's no real big failure example on lessons not working.,Jeff Long
109,"I feel like the packaging that you guys have vex IQ specifically in, is super tight.",Jeff Long
110,"So it's like real convenient for storage, but for kids and for students to be using that packaging.",Jeff Long
111,I found that I have to put it into bigger bins so that way they can actually find the pieces.,Jeff Long
112,"Because right now, especially on some of your connector pieces, the students, they'll spend 20 minutes looking this little box.",Jeff Long
113,I actually dump it into a larger bin so that way they can find the specific parts that they need.,Jeff Long
114,The other issue that we have found is students will sometimes lose little parts.,Jeff Long
115,"And some of those are like, there's only two of those parts inside the box or three of those parts inside the box.",Jeff Long
116,"Or if they lose one and they're trying to do some of these more advanced builds, all of a sudden, now we don't have the right parts to be able to do those more advanced builds because other students have lost them or done something with them that we can't find them.",Jeff Long
117,And usually we do a pretty good job of sweeping around the area to make sure that we don't pick up any of those parts.,Jeff Long
118,"But just the limitation if we're looking for, like, we need three pin connectors and there's only five pin connectors in the box, and you lose a couple of them, all of a sudden, after a couple of years, you've now not able to do that build anymore because the students have lost those parts.",Jeff Long
119,"So maybe just adding some, especially the really limited little pin connectors or maybe even some of the axles, adding some of that to the build parts.",Jeff Long
125,"Okay, thank you.",Jeff Long
126,This has been a great experience.,Jeff Long
127,Have a good day.,Jeff Long
1,Hi.,Crystal Cap
2,My name is Crystal Cap.,Crystal Cap
3,"I am from Chattanooga, Tennessee, and I currently teach 6th through 12th graders at the Chattanooga Girls Leadership Academy.",Crystal Cap
4,"I am the middle school computer science instructor, and I'm the lead robotics coach.",Crystal Cap
5,"We participate in the Vex VR, the program.",Crystal Cap
6,I have a little bit of experience with Beck's IQ from last year.,Crystal Cap
7,I used it with my computer science students.,Crystal Cap
8,"Unfortunately, I was new to the school and found out that our system needed to be upgraded, so I've been teaching for about 13 years.",Crystal Cap
19,"My goals are to inspire my students to be great problem solvers, use the engineering design process to explore careers that they may not have yet thought of.",Crystal Cap
20,It's pretty exciting for us.,Crystal Cap
21,We're trying to get our robotics team up and running.,Crystal Cap
22,"This was the first season in a couple of years, and it was just really neat to see how the girls jumped in full force and tried their best.",Crystal Cap
23,Even though we had some setbacks.,Crystal Cap
25,Was pretty successful year overall for our robotics team.,Crystal Cap
34,It would be great to have a guidebook for first year robotics coaches that really helped to set up first successful season.,Crystal Cap
35,So this is what you need to do at the beginning of the season.,Crystal Cap
36,"This is what the middle of the season, and this is what the end of the season looks like.",Crystal Cap
37,And if you don't have any experience with the Vex platform to just kind of break it down into smaller parts so that it doesn't feel so overwhelming when you're just getting started.,Crystal Cap
38,"We really kind of struggled to get the engineering notebook going, and then it was like, how do we get the programming going?",Crystal Cap
39,And it was a little overwhelming.,Crystal Cap
40,Just the girls didn't have any experience putting together the robot.,Crystal Cap
41,So that was a whole new learning curve for us.,Crystal Cap
42,So just some extra guidance and getting those things done.,Crystal Cap
43,I know that all of the stuff is out there on the web.,Crystal Cap
44,"I kind of found bits and pieces that I needed at different points in the season, but I didn't feel like there was this comprehensive handbook that was like, here's how you can be successful in your first season as a robotics coach.",Crystal Cap
49,"Some method of assessing progress for students, keeping some sort of a way to track data efficiently that's not so paper based.",Crystal Cap
50,Something online where I can keep up with how students are doing in matches and how the robot is progressing and has all the rubrics at my fingertips so that we can track our progress as a team.,Crystal Cap
62,I've really enjoyed the conference so far.,Crystal Cap
63,"I think this was a really great way for me to learn and grow about how I can implement Vex more in my school, not just as a competitive robotics, but across our curriculum.",Crystal Cap
64,"It would be great if next year there are some hands on components so that if you're a new coach and you've never built the robot, you have that experience.",Crystal Cap
65,"Maybe more smaller sessions that you could explore, some things that other teachers are doing that would be more hands on.",Crystal Cap
66,That would be a really fabulous addition to the conference.,Crystal Cap
67,Thanks for this opportunity.,Crystal Cap
72,I think that one of the big success stories for us this year was watching the students grow.,Crystal Cap
73,I had a core group of 6th graders that were so excited to come in and learn new things and try to solve the Vex Challenge this year and go out to competitions and really watching the friendships they developed within our local league and how they came back.,Crystal Cap
74,"And they're like, that didn't work.",Crystal Cap
75,So now we're going to try this.,Crystal Cap
76,"They really became really confident problem solvers, and that was amazing to see, and I can't wait to see what happens next season.",Crystal Cap
90,"I had a couple of students, and I don't know if it's necessarily the Vex or if it's just the format of Vex competition.",Crystal Cap
91,They just decided that they didn't enjoy robotics and they didn't want to continue participating.,Crystal Cap
92,And that's okay.,Crystal Cap
93,But I can't really think of anything that hasn't worked that I've tried.,Crystal Cap
94,It's all been good.,Crystal Cap
95,I think I lost.,Crystal Cap
0,Thank you.,
1,So this is Tori Aldridge again.,Tori Aldridge
2,My goals with Stem education are that we're in a rebuilding phase.,Tori Aldridge
3,We're trying to rebuild our program.,Tori Aldridge
4,"We're going from a program that hasn't had any capital investment in three years, if not longer, to trying to build a program that has at least one robotics team that's competitive of.",Tori Aldridge
5,And we're working with our district to get ten teams in our area to be able to compete in our area.,Tori Aldridge
6,"Specifically, I have been rebuilding the program using not just the supplies from Vex, but also by reaching out to community resources like the Denton Black Film Festival Technology Expo, where they wanted to teach, educate.",Tori Aldridge
7,"They provide teaching, education and culture to try to encourage kids to participate in Stem careers and also bringing in speakers that talk about the different types of careers in Stem.",Tori Aldridge
8,"And of course, coupling those resources with Code org's free curriculum, which allows kids to get in and make their own apps and make their own programs and learn a lot about the foundations of computer science.",Tori Aldridge
9,"Okay, great.",
10,"Now that we know what your goals are with Stem education, tell us what you feel some of the impediments might be.",
11,What is in the way of you achieving your goals instead of education?,
12,Is it teacher training?,
13,Do you need more professional development?,
14,You need to learn more about something like Python coding or you want to be better at engineering?,
15,"What is it that you feel if you learned or you did or you receive professional development on, or if we create a resource for you could really take what you are doing to the next.",
16,I think one resource that would be really helpful would be having a way to kind of see the path forward for each level.,Tori Aldridge
17,"For example, I started off with the vex IQ.",Tori Aldridge
18,"I can tell that the equipment is blue and that it's different, but there was also a different playing field.",Tori Aldridge
19,"There are different game pieces, and there are different things that I need in order to make that program work.",Tori Aldridge
20,"Also, I was trying to navigate and understand just by looking at the website, whether or not I needed a classroom set of something and how I could do that on a limited budget when I just had kind of a budget that was presented to me.",Tori Aldridge
21,So rolling this out in a single year doesn't seem as possible without having more vertical support.,Tori Aldridge
22,"And so I'd really like to have a really clear path forward when it comes to demonstrating for my vertical team how this looks, once it's implemented, what resources a teacher really needs in the classroom in order to implement this program.",Tori Aldridge
23,"And then from there, trying to get more horizontal support with being an ambassador for my community and my school community and enlisting other teachers to help me.",Tori Aldridge
24,"I've been an ambassador for other programs before, like I was a Talk Stem ambassador and the Texas foundation for Women supported our program and helped me to really recruit more diverse students as well as more girls into our program.",Tori Aldridge
25,"And so programs like that that already have a model for ambassadors to utilize as they are sharing their evangelistic message of why these types of programs are needed is really, really helpful.",Tori Aldridge
26,Also bringing people like our Kate Coordinator.,Tori Aldridge
27,Kate stands for Computer and Technology Education or Career and Technology Education.,Tori Aldridge
28,"Bringing our Kate Coordinator to events like this and having more than just a technology teacher presence, but having that vertical presence as well is extremely helpful for creating a culture and a climate that embrace this system and embrace different mindsets.",Tori Aldridge
29,"The last thing that I would add is that with Mindset training, I think you really need more ambassadors.",Tori Aldridge
30,"And that's something that I really try to do, is presenting more professional development topics and really talking to my peers and colleagues about how we can implement cross functional Stem projects like working with the music teacher to do.",Tori Aldridge
31,A music and Stem program with microbits or working with a math teacher to show her how she could use one of my vex IQ kits.,Tori Aldridge
32,In presenting a lesson.,Tori Aldridge
33,Those things are things that really help make this a culture shift and a mindset shift.,Tori Aldridge
34,And what I found is that a lot of teachers still have the mindset that technology and Stem is only for AP honors or gifted and talented kids.,Tori Aldridge
35,"I have done a lot of work in my classroom to bring in inclusive programming, programming that is scaffolded and differentiated for neurodiverse learners and different ability learners, as well as program that embraces racial, financial or socioeconomic equity as well as gender equity.",Tori Aldridge
36,And a lot of teachers aren't ready to do that or haven't really learned the language of embracing diversity and equity.,Tori Aldridge
37,"And so helping to develop resources that make it easier to share, that would be really helpful, really helpful.",Tori Aldridge
38,"When I was in the Talk Stem program, they have a repository of video clips from people using their products and people using technology tools and people talking about their careers that really help share their message and make it easy to share and spread in the classroom.",Tori Aldridge
39,And I was able to share that repository with any teacher who was interested at my school.,Tori Aldridge
40,"And so having something like that for Vex that's easily shareable and easily allows us to be an evangelist for the message of Stem education for all, really would be helpful.",Tori Aldridge
41,"Okay, this question is kind of related to the question I just asked.",
42,"If you could change one thing about either Vex or your Stem implementation, what would make your life easier as an educator, what could we provide for you that could really make what you're doing with Stem a lot easier than what you are currently doing right now?",
43,"Let us know that, please.",
44,We would love to be able to provide that for you.,
45,So I think packages that are kind of like a grab and go or the equivalent to what you would see in the clothing industry or retail industry as ready to wear.,Tori Aldridge
46,Having packages where I don't have to piece together all of the things would be really helpful.,Tori Aldridge
47,When I'm trying to sell to my Kate director or to my principal or to even the superintendent that I need X amount of dollars for a program.,Tori Aldridge
48,It's not really helpful to me being brand new to have to put that package together myself and go and get a specialized quote for a group of customized things that I'm not really sure is what I need yet.,Tori Aldridge
49,"I know it's disappointing for students to come into the classroom and have robotics kits that don't have a floor, or have a floor that doesn't have any games, or have one game, but not five different games for me to implement throughout the school year.",Tori Aldridge
50,And so implementing it in a really half baked approach doesn't lend itself to maintaining the enthusiasm of the students and doesn't lend itself to having to gaining more ambassadors and growing our program.,Tori Aldridge
51,"Also, I love the idea of starting with a robotics team.",Tori Aldridge
52,"Whenever I looked at the robotics team information, though, it was a little bit jumbled.",Tori Aldridge
53,There was a pretty antiquated looking user interface on the website and I had to navigate.,Tori Aldridge
54,"I had a difficulty navigating between that website and the website where I actually order things and the community, because I wasn't really in a community at the time.",Tori Aldridge
55,I wasn't in the PD Plus community yet.,Tori Aldridge
56,So making the navigation between those three more seamless and easier to access would only expand the number of people that I could share this with and have a greater ease of implementation.,Tori Aldridge
57,"All right, thank you for information.",
58,That's wonderful.,
59,Is there anything else that you want to share with us?,
60,"Anything that you want to share with us that you think, again, would be valuable feedback that we can take with us back to our offices?",
61,"And again, use your feedback to make any of our platforms or vet tool VR or Vex professional development blog that much better for you.",
62,So take this question again to just wax poetic about anything that you would like.,
63,Be honest with us.,
64,Be really honest.,
65,Don't be afraid to tell us that something that we have is terrible.,
66,Be honest with us and let us know what it is that we can do to improve.,
67,"Or if there is something that you really love, you can let us know that.",
68,Also.,
69,I think I heard that you guys were already developing out in the PD Plus system more resources for teachers.,Tori Aldridge
70,I went to the Vex website and saw a lot of the educational resources that you had even prior to our school joining the PD Plus program.,Tori Aldridge
71,"I really appreciated being able to come to Dallas to have the conference, and I also appreciated the fact that you guys have a scope and sequence available and you already have builds that can be done and so on and so forth.",Tori Aldridge
72,"I just think communicating more succinctly and having it in a more forward facing, accessible place would really improve our ability to implement the program quicker, faster.",Tori Aldridge
73,"We started out this year piloting robotics classes, and this is the second year, and we kind of have been piecing together what we were using with Plcw and then trying to ease into more of a Vex thing.",Tori Aldridge
74,"And then we were given these V Five robots for a middle school course, which I think was not the right choice.",Tori Aldridge
75,I think the Vex IQ would suit them better.,Tori Aldridge
76,But what we're going to need is to really hit the ground running next year with all the Vex IQ things so that we can set up a floor and be able to have our games and be able to really go full throttle with the entire scope and sequence and maintain the enthusiasm of our students.,Tori Aldridge
77,"The second thing that I did is I've been implementing the robotics team, and I kind of touched on this before, but I would really like to see my robotics team be able to thrive and having those resources be something that's less crowdsourced and more ready to implement or ready to wear, as I would compare, it would be really helpful.",Tori Aldridge
78,One of my favorite parts about this job is I get to travel the world and talk to educators all the time.,
79,"And I love hearing about the success stories with Vex Robotics, whether that's a parent talking about how their student now is so much more engaged in school as a result of Vex, or a student talking about how much they love engineering now, or much they love computer science.",
80,"If you have any of those success stories, whether it's about competitions, classrooms, or both, we would love to hear that.",
81,So please share that with us.,
82,"I did have students that came from other school districts, and they were very excited about being in robotics class.",Tori Aldridge
83,And this year has been a transition for us as we're trying to grow our program really from the ground up.,Tori Aldridge
84,So it was kind of a disappointment for them that we didn't have all the things.,Tori Aldridge
85,"But I can tell you I heard glowing reports from the students who came from places where their schools had the bags, and I think it even would hinder our ability to compete for those kids, because now that virtual school is a possibility and home school is becoming more doable for students as they get older.",Tori Aldridge
86,Both the parents that I've talked to and the students that I've talked to have told me that it's having a robotics class that really made their student interested in coming to school at our school.,Tori Aldridge
87,"And I think that if you're going to be in education and you want to see your census numbers maintained, I think that it's going to be imperative to have programs like Vex fully implemented at all levels in your school district to keep that enthusiasm and engagement up and to really keep students coming back into the local classroom at their local school.",Tori Aldridge
88,"Okay, this is one of my favorite questions to ask educators.",
89,"And again, please be honest, don't be shot.",
90,Tell me about that one lesson with Vex that went terrible.,
91,Tell me about that one lesson.,
92,You couldn't wait to walk into school and teach this particular lesson and it just went bad.,
93,It fell flat.,
94,It didn't work out for whatever reason.,
95,We would love to know why.,
96,So we can fix that particular lesson.,
97,"Now, as a corollary to that, you can either include this or as a war, let us know about that one student or that group of students that you were not able to reach with Vex.",
98,"You thought that after the exposure to your robotics club or to your or to your classroom with Vex that these students would want to want to pursue engineering careers or computer science or just really kind of be engaged with it, but for whatever reason, it didn't work out.",
99,We would love to hear that.,
100,"Okay, so for the students that I am not able to reach, typically, once they find out that the competition is on a Saturday and that they would not get to miss school, they get turned off.",Tori Aldridge
101,I'm not sure why other than the fact that maybe they just want to miss school.,Tori Aldridge
102,But I do have quite a few students that when I showed them the videos about competition and tried to get them engaged.,Tori Aldridge
103,"As far as seeing the vision as to where we are headed with our program, their feedback that I've gotten has been oh, I was really excited until you said it was on a Saturday.",Tori Aldridge
104,I don't want to give up my Saturday to go.,Tori Aldridge
105,So that was the feedback that I had from them about being engaged.,Tori Aldridge
106,Then.,Tori Aldridge
107,"As far as a program that fell flat, I haven't really done very many programs because I've had incomplete sets.",Tori Aldridge
108,"And I can't stress enough how, as an educator, how frustrating it is to order what you think is a kit and then not have all the bells and whistles to make that work.",Tori Aldridge
109,"Like having two sets, which is what I ended up getting because that's all I could have on my budget.",Tori Aldridge
110,Or that's all you had at the time.,Tori Aldridge
111,"Having only two sets was really a hindrance because it's like I was able to order the two complete sets, but the students that I have are just way too numerous for that.",Tori Aldridge
112,"And I love the way our administration has really made it so that most of the students are taking our class through a technology wheel, but I won't get that chance again.",Tori Aldridge
113,And so this is one opportunity that I've had to have a captive audience.,Tori Aldridge
114,"And that was just kind of a botched opportunity due to the fact that I couldn't order enough of the materials and I didn't have enough of the materials in order to make complete activities and complete sets or even do a basic build, which I had found on your website.",Tori Aldridge
115,So thank you very much for participating with our survey.,
116,"We, of course, are not going to share any of your information with anyone.",
117,We will keep everything confidential.,
118,We just want to use this for our internal purposes to make our products better for you.,
119,"Thank you for your participation in the Veteran Wise Indicators Conference, and thank you for everything that you are doing.",
120,Thank you.,Tori Aldridge
121,Thank you.,
0,Okay.,
1,Hi.,Tori Aldridge
2,My name is Tori Aldridge.,Tori Aldridge
3,"I'm a technology teacher from Denton, Texas, which is a suburb right outside of Dallas Fort Worth.",Tori Aldridge
4,I have been using Vex V five controllers.,Tori Aldridge
5,They were kind of given to us from the high school program when they had some extra funds.,Tori Aldridge
6,When I came in three years ago.,Tori Aldridge
7,"I was a brand new teacher, and.",Tori Aldridge
8,"I was taking over from someone else who had gone, and the program had kind of lost all of its equipment.",Tori Aldridge
9,So we had no what I call computer brains.,Tori Aldridge
10,We didn't have any brains for the robots.,Tori Aldridge
11,"We had some cogs and some wheels, but a lot of things were either missing or in disrepair.",Tori Aldridge
12,So we were able to get some extra funds to purchase some Vex IQ.,Tori Aldridge
13,"Set, but I was only able to get two.",Tori Aldridge
14,"I have about 60 no, about 45 6th grade students that use the Vex IQ.",Tori Aldridge
15,And then I have about 120 students.,Tori Aldridge
16,"That are in Level One courses, which.",Tori Aldridge
17,We call them Level One robotics.,Tori Aldridge
18,And then the other students are in.,Tori Aldridge
19,A Level Three course where they are taking Code AP computer Science Principles course.,Tori Aldridge
20,So we're in transition.,Tori Aldridge
21,We're really trying to recruit a lot.,Tori Aldridge
22,More kids this year because we have not had a robotics program at our school.,Tori Aldridge
23,But as a computer science teacher and someone who was trained in computer science.,Tori Aldridge
24,I'm very keen on giving them a way to apply their knowledge with something.,Tori Aldridge
25,That they can touch and feel.,Tori Aldridge
26,And they've been very excited about using.,Tori Aldridge
27,The Vex system for building robots.,Tori Aldridge
28,Okay.,Tori Aldridge
0,I am Jacob Roberts.,Jacob Roberts
1,I am one of the assistant program managers for our competitive Robotics in San Fran Valley school districts.,Jacob Roberts
2,I work alongside great team of leadership that helps us run lots of competitions for hundreds of teams within our district in Colorado.,Jacob Roberts
3,So that's a great opportunity.,Jacob Roberts
4,"I don't teach any courses, but I help run some PDS for our teachers to get them ready to coach teams.",Jacob Roberts
5,And then I also facilitate and run our student team that runs all of our tournaments throughout the season.,Jacob Roberts
6,"They set up, do all the refing scorekeeping and then tear down those tournaments for us every weekend.",Jacob Roberts
7,"Overall, with Stem education, we're just looking to continue to grow.",Jacob Roberts
8,"We've been doing Stem since I was a student in our district, using Vex since I was a sophomore in our district, maybe a freshman.",Jacob Roberts
9,"And so continuing to grow, that making sure that all of our schools are able to access the Stem education that we provide, particularly through Vex.",Jacob Roberts
10,"We try to make sure that all those opportunities are equitable and accessible during the season and prior to and all of that, make sure all of our coaches are able to understand the game themselves and be able to coach teams throughout the season.",Jacob Roberts
11,"I think one of the things that would help us go beyond where we're currently at is, one being able to have a communication tool that allows us to reach out to our teams easier than just sending out an email or a newsletter every week.",Jacob Roberts
12,And then the other thing is I get a lot of questions in my position from coaches on very specific topics.,Jacob Roberts
13,"And while I can personally go and search through the Vex forums myself, the Q and A's and all that, and send those coaches to those locations, being able to be more knowledgeable on that myself without getting too into the weeds of doing an entire robot build would be huge.",Jacob Roberts
14,Like these questions on the and I.,
15,"Mean, maybe outside the scope of what we're talking about with the Educator Conference, but one of the things that comes to mind for ease and accessibility within our program at the scale we're at in St.",Jacob Roberts
16,"Brain is just simply looking at portability, being able to get resources between schools and having that available when it comes to competitions, getting all the parts that we need to a competition easy and things like that.",Jacob Roberts
17,So that's what I'm always looking at as kind of the person who looks at moving all the things around throughout the season.,Jacob Roberts
18,You.,
19,"In general, I've enjoyed being a part of this kind of Vex ecosystem from being a student who helped run tournaments to now being in the position of teaching students how to run tournaments and being that resource for coaches.",Jacob Roberts
20,So I can't necessarily think of anything off the top of my mind.,Jacob Roberts
21,"I'll spend a second here to think at the very least going through my mental kind of cabinet I don't think of anything that I have a qualm with from my position, running tournaments and making sure that we're scaling well within the district.",Jacob Roberts
22,I get to work very closely with our high school student team and seeing them develop as professionals adjacent to Vex.,Jacob Roberts
23,"They're not necessarily competing in those competitions, but they're working around with all that same stuff they're doing all the setup, all the tear down, interacting with the teams, interacting with our key volunteers like our head reps and our judge advisors.",Jacob Roberts
24,And so being able to kind of watch them grow.,Jacob Roberts
25,Similar stories to what I've heard at the conference so far this year.,Jacob Roberts
26,Some of those stories of coming out and finding your position within a team and all that.,Jacob Roberts
27,So that's been really cool perspective for me.,Jacob Roberts
28,"Yeah, in my position, I'm not working too closely in that one on one space.",Jacob Roberts
29,"But I've done a few of our professional developments for our teachers in the district, getting them ready to coach new teams and be ready to build their program on their end.",Jacob Roberts
30,"And so some of those frustrating pieces of not being able to get them to be able to build their own robot in a timely manner and be ready for our kind of end of day competition that we're doing during those PDS, we get those teachers in the room.",Jacob Roberts
31,I run the PD as a team.,Jacob Roberts
32,"I'm the coach and the mentor, and they're all the students building robots.",Jacob Roberts
33,"And so getting them to that point where they can have a functioning moving robot at the end of the day, that's one of those funny, little missed parts of that education.",Jacob Roberts
34,It.,
35,Gives me enough.,Jacob Roberts
0,"So this is our first year running Vex over at our school in Los Angeles, California.",Bernie Contreras
1,"And what we want to do, or what we hope to do, is to incorporate robotics throughout the core subjects.",Bernie Contreras
2,So not necessarily looking to expand more buy in throughout the campus.,Bernie Contreras
3,I currently teach fifth grade.,Bernie Contreras
4,One of the other teacher that's doing it is also an upper grade teacher.,Bernie Contreras
5,We just got in one of the lower grade teachers this year.,Bernie Contreras
6,So we're just trying to get buy in throughout the school to support our robotics.,Bernie Contreras
7,"We're using the Vex IQ and the Vex Go, and the Vex one, two, three with the lower grades, but we're using it.",Bernie Contreras
8,"But we're trying to get buy in so that other teachers use it as part of their daily curriculum to truly meet the needs of not only our students, but also the title of Stem or Steam School that we have.",Bernie Contreras
9,Keep going.,
10,"Say your name and district or school, if you don't mind.",
11,Okay.,Bernie Contreras
12,"I am Bernie Contreras, fifth grade teacher over at Montague Charter Academy in Bokoima, California.",Bernie Contreras
13,"I think one of the primary things that I'm looking for with coming out, we don't have a team representing us in World.",Bernie Contreras
14,"We made it as far as State, but the reason why we came out is, again, to get teacher buy in.",Bernie Contreras
15,"So definitely looking for strategies to be able to present this in a way that is not only beneficial to the students and helps to create a rigorous curriculum, but also something that is reasonably attainable for teachers to be able to do, given the nature of the faculty.",Bernie Contreras
16,"Over at our school, we have a lot of older teachers that are used to the traditional format with teaching, with directed instruction, teacher led instruction where they're teaching from the board.",Bernie Contreras
17,"And so to incorporate technology, I'm trying to find very simple ways to be able to display it, which I've seen so far today.",Bernie Contreras
18,"So that's what we're really hoping for today, finding ways where I can present this to burst my grade level and then to be able to go beyond that and show that with the examples that we're showing with Vex.",Bernie Contreras
19,"One, two, three.",Bernie Contreras
20,I think those hit it right on.,Bernie Contreras
21,"That's more what I'm looking for, some sort of development.",Bernie Contreras
22,"If I understood the question correctly, I think that the program is sufficient for me right now.",Bernie Contreras
23,I would say that I'm very just getting myself oriented with the program.,Bernie Contreras
24,This is our first year having it.,Bernie Contreras
25,"I did see it last year, but we didn't really use it with the students.",Bernie Contreras
26,"But I think what would make it easier for me, really, is just more experience with it at the moment.",Bernie Contreras
27,"Beyond that, I don't have any really good constructive feedback to be able to give on that at the moment.",Bernie Contreras
28,Okay.,Bernie Contreras
29,I think one of the things that I really enjoyed about today's seminar so far has been how they presented how vex was able to be utilized as a resource for our special ed population.,Bernie Contreras
30,"I think if I could see how we could implement this, because I also am working with the gifted program at my school.",Bernie Contreras
31,How can we implement this with the gifted?,Bernie Contreras
32,How can we implement this with our English language learners?,Bernie Contreras
33,How could we implement this across curriculums?,Bernie Contreras
34,"I did hear talk about Vex being a tool that teachers can use to go across the curriculum, to be able to include multiple subjects.",Bernie Contreras
35,"But if we could see more of that, I think that would be good.",Bernie Contreras
36,"I did take a lot of notes, and it did generate a lot of ideas, but I'm hoping to see more of that again, since I'm hoping to take back what I learned here, to be able to develop professional developments or really just to display how beneficial this program is for the demographics of my school.",Bernie Contreras
37,I would love to see more of that's.,Bernie Contreras
38,My sincere I didn't catch that question.,Bernie Contreras
39,I'm rewinding it right now to hear it again.,Bernie Contreras
40,"Well, if I can share the story, I couldn't necessarily pinpoint one story that maybe you guys haven't heard already or doesn't fit the paradigm right?",Bernie Contreras
41,Because we've had all of those stories.,Bernie Contreras
42,The narrative of student disengage introduce Vex.,Bernie Contreras
43,"But I think one of the biggest highlights for me, so that the community that I service, the neighborhood that our school is in, is the same neighborhood that I grew up and was raised in.",Bernie Contreras
44,"And students primarily are focused on athletics, on finding success in entertainment.",Bernie Contreras
45,"And so to hear my students, the kids in my neighborhood, the kids that have all of the pitfalls that neighborhoods similar to Paquima have to actually be considering robotics or engineering or anything within that field as a potential career to me is badass.",Bernie Contreras
46,"And I don't know if I'm allowed to cuss on this or not, but it makes me so happy to see that and to hear that.",Bernie Contreras
47,"And when we made it to State, we were recognized by our local government for doing that.",Bernie Contreras
48,"When I would see these news stories in the past, I guess because I couldn't relate to them, they weren't hitting home.",Bernie Contreras
49,This is amazing.,Bernie Contreras
50,We've had some local celebrities because of their choice of going into entertainment or going into the field of athletics.,Bernie Contreras
51,"But this is so much more realistic, in my opinion.",Bernie Contreras
52,I'm all about USC.,Bernie Contreras
53,"I work also with USC, so I apologize if anybody hears a Bruin or UCLA, which is also a great school.",Bernie Contreras
54,"But I tell my students there's a much greater chance if you were to pursue robotics, to be able to pursue a career in it.",Bernie Contreras
55,"I mean, the numbers are in their favor.",Bernie Contreras
56,So to have a program like this to pull them in is almost similar to these clinics that these different organizations are running.,Bernie Contreras
57,"We have LAFC that runs a soccer clinic, and we've had the Clippers run clinics in our neighborhood.",Bernie Contreras
58,"And so to have robotics run these programs and get kids interested, man, I could go on for days about this, but I also want to head out to lunch.",Bernie Contreras
59,I'm going to go on to the next question.,Bernie Contreras
60,"All right, thank you, guys.",Bernie Contreras
61,Have a blessed and beautiful one.,Bernie Contreras
6,"Right, my name is Bridget Myers.",Bridget Myers
7,I teach at Highland Park Middle School.,Bridget Myers
8,"This is my 9th year teaching that I started off as a actually health teacher and coach, worked my way up to science, and now I'm teaching engineering and teaching graphic design.",Bridget Myers
9,"So I've always had an interest in coding and robotics and building, and I love that I get to do that.",Bridget Myers
10,Now.,Bridget Myers
11,We use the Vex IQ robots.,Bridget Myers
12,It's our second year using them.,Bridget Myers
13,"Our high school uses the Vex V five, and they have a robotics team and robotics classes, and they actually do compete.",Bridget Myers
14,Our middle school does not yet compete.,Bridget Myers
15,We just use robotics in the engineering classroom and have just been looking for ways to implement it into our other classes and really introduce it from where I use it in the 8th grade to our fifth and 6th graders that are on the other side of the building.,Bridget Myers
27,I actually have a couple of goals with Stem education.,Bridget Myers
28,So one of the first ones is going to be just getting more girls in the classroom.,Bridget Myers
29,So I have two engineering classes right now.,Bridget Myers
30,They're the CTE classes.,Bridget Myers
31,"One is all boys, 22 boys, and the other one is six girls and 18 boys.",Bridget Myers
32,And so both do well in there.,Bridget Myers
33,But I would love to see more equity in that.,Bridget Myers
34,"Obviously, being a female teacher myself and just coming from an all girls high school where I can see just what women can do, that is one of my goals.",Bridget Myers
35,Another one of my goals is getting robotics as a standalone electives class for our 7th graders and for our 8th graders.,Bridget Myers
36,"So having a class, having more scaffolding in our robotics program.",Bridget Myers
37,"So there is a high school credit, robotics one and two class that they can take at the high school.",Bridget Myers
38,"So really looking at how can we start adding this earlier and earlier, and how can we make sure that what they're doing is adding on and complementing without making the curriculum redundant?",Bridget Myers
39,So I would like ultimately to make it district wide.,Bridget Myers
40,We have done that with our languages other than English.,Bridget Myers
41,So now we have a K twelve Spanish program.,Bridget Myers
42,And so I know that the district is interested in doing that.,Bridget Myers
43,Obviously it's just about showing value.,Bridget Myers
44,"So if I can start by making elective classes in 7th and 8th grade just for standalone for robotics or implementing them within another type of class, then we can really see that as a program that goes throughout the district.",Bridget Myers
45,The other one is just about another goal is just personally.,Bridget Myers
46,"So obviously I'm newer to coding and robotics, although I know how to code and I have had some experience with building robots.",Bridget Myers
47,That's not what my training comes from.,Bridget Myers
48,And so I have to make sure that as I'm building these classes that I'm making sure that I am putting myself in a position to just constantly be learning and growing so that I can help my students do the same.,Bridget Myers
56,"So what I've been looking with looking at is just again, just increasing my knowledge base.",Bridget Myers
57,"I think also it would be taking, yes, some cookie cutter courses and being able to implement those in the classroom, but also the next level of understanding how to teach better in the day to day.",Bridget Myers
58,That is going to drive student initiative and student inquiry.,Bridget Myers
59,"So I can get the students doing the activity, I can get the students engaged in the activity.",Bridget Myers
60,"But how can I get them invested in now making, creating, designing where they feel comfortable doing and exploring and failing and succeeding on their own?",Bridget Myers
61,"I'm not sure if that makes sense, but I really want to be able to let them continue to make their own decisions and make their own research, working collaboratively in a team.",Bridget Myers
62,"And there are a lot of really good products that I've used as far as lessons go, insects on that.",Bridget Myers
63,But also I think that just takes time and making sure they like to be handheld sometimes with the robotics if they're new with it.,Bridget Myers
64,So they want me to be with them every step of the way with the code and with the build and does this look good?,Bridget Myers
65,And so having them be confident in their own design process is something that I need to get just better at as a teacher.,Bridget Myers
70,So what would make my life easier?,Bridget Myers
71,"We've had some issues with just software and getting we use one to one Chromebooks with our students, and so to get coding on the IQs, we haven't had success with the web based, and I think that may just be because of some of the restrictions on the Chromebooks that our districts have put on.",Bridget Myers
72,"But if there were an easier way for students to have a hub where they could code together or ideate and almost have like a digital notebook that actually if there was something through Google or something like that, that would be a lot easier.",Bridget Myers
73,I found myself I make my own slide deck from what I get out of decks whenever we're doing the program.,Bridget Myers
74,"So we just did Tug of War competition, and we just also did what was the one that we just did after that?",Bridget Myers
75,It was the treasure hunt.,Bridget Myers
76,So we did tug of war and treasure hunt.,Bridget Myers
77,"So I took the modules from that one through five, and I would go in and I would download every doc, save my own copy.",Bridget Myers
78,"And then I would take what was from the website, I would copy and paste all the text, and I would paraphrase it or change it or whatever we need to in the graphics and put that in a slide deck to walk the students through it.",Bridget Myers
79,"So that I found was really useful, especially for me and for them, when I would put it into a slide deck and get put time limits up on the board of it of today, we're starting Treasure Hunt, and here's what our goal is.",Bridget Myers
80,"And then I'd say, okay, take five minutes, ten minutes with your team to work on pseudocode, to do XYZ, or take five minutes to draw in your notebooks what you did or what you've completed.",Bridget Myers
81,So having that kind of stepped out working in the classroom has made it a lot easier for me.,Bridget Myers
82,"But it took some time to collect all those materials, so then I could use them myself in the slideshow as I'm teaching and make sure that I didn't go on any tangents or get off track, and then also make sure that I could push everything out to the students in Google Classroom.",Bridget Myers
83,"I also took and changed the quizzes that were in the notebooks, and I put those into Google Forms so that the students could have immediate feedback whenever they took those to make sure that they were understanding the concepts.",Bridget Myers
84,All those check for understandings are put into Google Forms.,Bridget Myers
85,"And now google has these practice sets which works, but I think there's still some quirks in that.",Bridget Myers
86,"So Google form is still a bit better, but they could get the immediate feedback on if they were ready to move on.",Bridget Myers
87,So I said their group had to get a certain grade in order to move on.,Bridget Myers
88,"And for us as a class to work on the next challenge, make sure there's no man left behind.",Bridget Myers
89,I think continued access to Vex IQ.,Bridget Myers
90,"I wish I had done a bit more to do smaller coding challenges in sorry, it's Vex VR is what I'm talking about.",Bridget Myers
91,"To do smaller coding challenges in that so that whenever we got to the coding parts of Treasure Hunt, specifically, that we could have had more students feel like they were fluent in the coding portion itself.",Bridget Myers
92,"So, honestly, like many challenges in Vex VR that aid with some of those challenges, or, like, if those could point back and forth, I think the immediate feedback of the coding on that was actually invaluable, and I'm planning on using that more next year.",Bridget Myers
103,"That also, I think just access to the Stem labs, because that's really what I've mostly been using, has been so helpful.",Bridget Myers
104,"I was planning on doing robotics for a month in engineering, and it ended up being a full nine weeks, and that was honestly really useful for us.",Bridget Myers
105,And I think the kids enjoyed it as well.,Bridget Myers
106,They did get frustrated in the Treasure Hunt.,Bridget Myers
107,They had a really hard time with the angles on the drivetrain and making sure that it turned.,Bridget Myers
108,"And so when we came time for our actual competition, one of my class periods, we didn't have a single robot fully complete the challenge because I had switched up the order of the pucks, and when we were practicing it, they had stayed in the same one.",Bridget Myers
109,And so having the same color multiple times in a row messed up a couple of the robots.,Bridget Myers
110,But it's been a good challenge.,Bridget Myers
111,They've been troubleshooting on the way.,Bridget Myers
112,Having access to everything in Google has been really helpful.,Bridget Myers
113,"It's been a bit annoying having to go in and save, but I don't really know if you can do that another way.",Bridget Myers
114,I think that's kind of the nature of Google Drive.,Bridget Myers
115,I'm trying to think of what else in Beck.,Bridget Myers
116,"If there's anything in Beck, I would like more information on ways to continue doing this cross curricular and that may be something in Vex PD Plus that I am not seeing because I didn't do it this year.",Bridget Myers
117,"I did it last year, which is how I'm at the conference.",Bridget Myers
118,But it is something I'm planning on hopefully enrolling in again in the fall.,Bridget Myers
119,But more ways to I think there's a lot of power in having something built by older students and presented to younger students and giving them the opportunity to be the teacher and to be the problem solver.,Bridget Myers
120,And I think that builds a lot of confidence and that also helps get our younger kids invested in what's going on and gives them something to look forward to.,Bridget Myers
121,"So my question to one of your staff was how could I take the Vex IQ that we're doing in engineering, have the students design or program a robot and then take it to our fifth or 6th graders?",Bridget Myers
122,Take it to those kiddos that are in just any their advisory so it's any sort of teacher and present it to them and give them a challenge to do with a robot that's built.,Bridget Myers
123,"So I don't know if that's possible, but that's a question I'd like to see if we can I love the idea of bringing a robot to our friends in special education and also giving the opportunity for students to help students in that.",Bridget Myers
124,So I would be happy to give more feedback.,Bridget Myers
125,I think that's all I got for now.,Bridget Myers
130,So using it in the engineering classroom has really given me the chance to see students problem solve and get hands on experience with all facets of the engineering design process.,Bridget Myers
131,It was really cool.,Bridget Myers
132,I got to have our administrators come in when we did our Beckhtucker War challenge and some of our students and teachers from other classes.,Bridget Myers
133,"And what was wonderful is that there was the spirit of the competition, but also you could see that the students were trying in the few minutes they had in between matches to improve on their design and they were seeing what other kids were doing.",Bridget Myers
134,And I think they were learning and taking away so much just from that.,Bridget Myers
135,"And so I think I'm reading a book about just stemming classrooms and that presentation, how you actually what you do with your end product is so important.",Bridget Myers
136,"And so I think what we do, what you all are doing with the competitions that are here, like X Worlds, but also just competitions within the classroom and problem solving within the classroom, to be able to present for more than just a grade and be able to present for more than just a teacher is such a powerful thing.",Bridget Myers
137,And so taking that and using that in different ways has been something that has given back just in a lot of ways for our students.,Bridget Myers
147,So I actually recently had some students that were kind of defeated and said they still didn't quite understand coding.,Bridget Myers
148,"And that was surprising because we had been in it for a while, but it was interesting that we'd gone through everything with VR and they'd had robots to work but really had taken the backseat.",Bridget Myers
149,And part of that was my fault.,Bridget Myers
150,I did groups bigger than I should.,Bridget Myers
151,But you really are fighting when students get frustrated that they shut down and they just don't want to participate.,Bridget Myers
152,And so just making sure that that's why I talked about doing more of XVR from the start.,Bridget Myers
153,And I think leading in more coding before actually getting to robotics would be helpful because there are some students that already know some python and already know some coding and then there are some that really have just kind of avoided it because it's this big scary thing that they are intimidated by.,Bridget Myers
0,"Okay, my name is Chris Gingri, and I teach at Buna elementary.",Chris Gingri
1,"I teach K through five engineering lab, and and that's where students come in.",Chris Gingri
2,"I have one grade level a week with their science teachers, and they come in, and we do an engineering design build based on our challenge, based on what they learned in science before they came in.",Chris Gingri
3,"I've integrated robotics with that using the Dash from WonderWorks and the Sparrow from Spiro, and they are learning coding as well.",Chris Gingri
4,Starting in kindergarten.,Chris Gingri
5,I have vex goes.,Chris Gingri
6,I've just gotten my set of Vex Goes in to start an after school robotics club with fourth and fifth grade.,Chris Gingri
7,"Eventually, it'll go to third grade, and I haven't used much Vexico yet.",Chris Gingri
8,"I've done all the training, but this is our next step.",Chris Gingri
9,"Our junior high and high schools do Vexco competitions, and so we're bringing it down to the elementary level starting next year.",Chris Gingri
10,My experiences with Vex are limited other than professional development that I've done and playing around with it myself.,Chris Gingri
11,So I'm excited about what's going to come.,Chris Gingri
12,I think that's all the questions for this slide.,Chris Gingri
13,"We actually built them for our sacrifice, and we given them advisory, and we're.",
14,"So our goals with education that science teaks for Texas in 2024 are changing, and they're adding an engineering lab component to all of the science peaks.",Chris Gingri
15,And so what we did this past year was that we started the engineering lab where the students come and do that engineering build based on their science peaks.,Chris Gingri
16,"And my goal is as far as BECs goes and as far as Stem goes, is to have Stem engineering in all subjects.",Chris Gingri
17,"I mean, that's a big goal, and it scares all the other teachers.",Chris Gingri
18,But our goal with the coding is I want to start pushing the robots out of my lab and into the classrooms where the teachers are implementing activities to go with their lessons.,Chris Gingri
19,So I'm babystepping them through.,Chris Gingri
20,"They're coming into the lab and learning some of it, and they're kind of getting scared about when you say the word coding.",Chris Gingri
21,"Oh, we don't do coding.",Chris Gingri
22,So my goal is to get them comfortable with the technology and show them that they can use it and that all subject areas can do Stem.,Chris Gingri
23,Not just science.,Chris Gingri
24,It.,
25,Some of my impediments are understanding coding.,Chris Gingri
26,"If you're a regular Ed teacher, coding is something that's a challenge.",Chris Gingri
27,"I have taken upon myself to learn computer sciences last year to learn how to write JavaScript, but not every teacher is going to do that.",Chris Gingri
28,"And so when my science teachers come into the lab with their students and I say, oh, we're going to code today, they have this knee jerk reaction, oh, coding.",Chris Gingri
29,That's computer stuff.,Chris Gingri
30,We don't do coding.,Chris Gingri
31,"So my biggest impediment is getting teachers to realize that, hey, it's just dragging and dropping blocks.",Chris Gingri
32,It's not this great big you're not writing JavaScript or Python.,Chris Gingri
33,"So getting the teachers to understand that, hey, this is not that difficult to do.",Chris Gingri
34,This is kindergartners can do it.,Chris Gingri
35,We as teachers can do it.,Chris Gingri
36,"And getting the teachers to want to add that aspect of Stem into their classrooms when they have so many other things that they're having to do, and we're asking them to do one more thing.",Chris Gingri
37,So my biggest thing is how can I teach the teachers or where's the professional development to teach the teachers how to quickly and easily integrate robots into their teacher?,Chris Gingri
38,"I think they maybe videos for me to be able to show teachers, hey, this is what we could do with this robot.",Chris Gingri
39,Look how easy it is.,Chris Gingri
40,Because I can show them.,Chris Gingri
41,"But sometimes me showing them and then maybe them having a professional development video to be able to step, they could watch it step by step and say, okay, do this first, do this second.",Chris Gingri
42,This is how you can do this next.,Chris Gingri
43,There's not very much professional development out there for teachers to incorporate robotics into curriculum.,Chris Gingri
44,"And if I say, okay, you can incorporate this into a read aloud, they just get glassy eyed, like, oh, I wouldn't even know how to start.",Chris Gingri
45,So maybe simple step by step instructions for teachers.,Chris Gingri
46,This is how you would incorporate it into a read aloud or incorporate it into a math less.,Chris Gingri
47,"I love the Vex goes, and I'm just now getting to experience them, and I've just been introduced to the Vex.",Chris Gingri
48,"One, two, three.",Chris Gingri
49,So I'm in love with the product.,Chris Gingri
50,"I think you'll have a great product, a great platform.",Chris Gingri
51,"I've looked at the summer camp things, and I love how you have it all laid out where there's no planning needed.",Chris Gingri
52,"I can just print the stuff and say, okay, this is what I need to do.",Chris Gingri
53,"You already have all of the step by step agendas done, the timing done, you've done a lot of great thinking about that.",Chris Gingri
54,"So if we could take it from the camp level down to, okay, this is how we can do it in a classroom setting one lesson using that camp format where it's all laid out completely, where the teachers don't have to do any guesswork, I think that would be perfect.",Chris Gingri
55,Thank you.,Chris Gingri
56,"So the success story we have for our little title one school district is our high schoolers have done the Vex IQs, and they go to competitions and they can't compete because they don't get any robotics until high school coding or anything like that.",Chris Gingri
57,"And so this past year, the junior high teacher started Vex IQs with the middle school.",Chris Gingri
58,"And again, it's just like, okay, they come into middle school, they have no background.",Chris Gingri
59,"And so we're now brought it, the Vex down to elementary.",Chris Gingri
60,So that's a success because we're able to vertically align from elementary all the way through our high school.,Chris Gingri
61,"And also, our junior high has always only offered art and band as an elective, and we were able to successfully push adding a robotics choice.",Chris Gingri
62,"So starting next school year, our 6th and 7th and 8th graders can choose to do a robotics elective with the Vex IQs.",Chris Gingri
63,"Instead of just having the choice of art or band, they now get to the choice of art, band, or robotics with the Vex IQ.",Chris Gingri
64,So I think that's a success story for the three of us that have tried really hard to collaborate and vertically align it and push it to our school board.,Chris Gingri
65,"And also, it's a success because now our students, even the ones that aren't going to ever compete, they will get the opportunity to learn this and learn all the things that go along with coding and robotics in an elective setting.",Chris Gingri
66,So it's exciting for us and it's exciting for our students.,Chris Gingri
67,"Well, I can't wait to have those experiences.",Chris Gingri
68,I'm looking forward to the Robotics club next year.,Chris Gingri
69,We're just starting.,Chris Gingri
70,"So next year at this conference, I'll have an answer for you.",Chris Gingri
71,"Okay, that's good questions.",Chris Gingri
0,Okay.,Randall Carter
1,This is our first year.,Randall Carter
2,We've been very impressed with the educational professional development training material that's been on the website.,Randall Carter
3,And being here at the conference has been very impactful thus far.,Randall Carter
4,The staff has been great and resourceful on everything that we've needed thus far.,Randall Carter
5,The communication has been great.,Randall Carter
6,"I don't have any areas of improvements at this time, but all I would say is our experience has been to this point it's been great and we look forward to working more with the organization.",Randall Carter
7,We just started utilizing Vex IQ.,Randall Carter
8,It's been a great success for our students.,Randall Carter
9,They have been very successful in the process thus far.,Randall Carter
10,We're preparing them for robotics competitions for the 23 24 season and it's been very impactful what they've learned using the Vex IQ.,Randall Carter
11,The process has been very empowering to our youth thus far.,Randall Carter
12,Most of our youth that are participating in a program go on to be majors in engineering or technology majors.,Randall Carter
13,It's been very impactful.,Randall Carter
14,Some challenges have been some students not really able to adapt to it right?,Randall Carter
15,But that's a small percentage.,Randall Carter
16,"We work in collaborative efforts, collaborative environments rather.",Randall Carter
17,"And some do very well in the coding, some do very well in the building.",Randall Carter
18,But collaboratively they are able to accomplish great things.,Randall Carter
19,"So overall I think it's great, but I'm the best.",Randall Carter
20,But mechanically.,Randall Carter
0,My name is Randall Carter and I'm the executive director for Metrain Youth Through Technology.,
1,You'll ask another.,
2,Was there a question?,
3,We provide Stem training in multiple areas.,
4,We use Vex IQ and Vex VXP.,
5,We currently love the products.,
6,This is our first year teaching the products.,
7,We've been doing Stem for the last nine years.,
8,This is our first year using Vex and we're very excited to use the product.,
0,"All right, first off, I'm not a teacher.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
1,The only quote unquote teaching I do is I volunteer as a robotics coach for the Bel Air Public School system.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
2,"It started off six years ago with my son, joined a Vex robotics team, and I got involved as a mentor and coach and have been involved ever since.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
3,We use both Vexiq and VRC platforms.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
4,"We started off on the VRC side with the introduction of V Five, got in on that first season there.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
5,"And with me, I've got a background in it.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
6,"I've been in the It industry for 23, 24 years almost now.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
7,"So I've done software programming, I've done network infrastructure, servers, all that jazz.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
8,"My dad's an engineer by trade, building a submarine and all kinds of other stuff.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
9,So I know the mechanical side of it.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
10,So mentoring a robotics team just came really easy for me.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
11,"But here at the conference, trying to figure out how to use Vex outside of the Vex robotics competition to try and get more students involved with the competitive robotics side, hopefully, that answers the question.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
12,"All right, so my goals with Stem education, like I said in the previous answer, I'm here at the Educated Conference to try and learn myself how to best teach the skills required for the Vex competition side to the students that are coming into the competitive robotics with our school district.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
13,The teachers at the school aren't using Vex outside of one science teacher that started with the Vex program.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
14,So I'm also keeping my eyes and ears open for ideas and ways that we can expand the Vex program at the school to incorporate the students into the Vex platform at an earlier age.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
15,"So they're familiar with it, and they have a lot of the basic understandings how to program, how to assemble the Vex parts, that type of thing, before they even get into the competitive program with our school.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
16,"I feel if the like, the the PD Plus platform, I just recently learned about that, that I have access to it as a coach about two weeks ago.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
17,So I haven't really had a chance to get in there and see what all is available there.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
18,"But just so far, being in one session with the conference, seeing how other schools are using the Vex platform in the classroom outside of competitive robotics, having that information available that I can share back with the rest of the educators at the school district would be amazing.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
19,Thanks.,
20,And then expanding on that.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
21,"One of the big problems that I see and hear from parents and other coaches on the competitive side is they don't know how to program, they don't know how to teach the robotics to their team.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
22,"So I've kind of been helping out with that, but I myself struggle with it.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
23,"So having more resources available to teach the non educators how to educate the basics of programming, how to educate the basics of mechanical engineering and iterative design would be super helpful and it would definitely be a toolkit in my bag of tricks to pass along to other coaches.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
24,Sorry about that.,
25,"Okay, so yeah, yeah.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
26,"From the educator standpoint, like I said, I'm not an educator, so it's hard for me to answer that one.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
27,The one thing that I keep running into that would be a great resource from Vex is simply like a newsletter announcement for new products.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
28,"So as an excellent example, I'm here at World inspecting and I had no idea that five and six inch standoffs were now a valid Vex part.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
29,"Last time I looked at the standoffs on the store, I think the longest one was four inches until I saw one on a robot coming through inspection.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
30,"So having some sort of announcement saying, hey, these are the new products available that are competition legal for IQ or competition legal for VRC or Vexu.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
31,And being able to subscribe to those updates would be super helpful.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
32,Everything.,
33,"I think as far as what can be improved, additional communication to coaches.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
34,"For example, like I said earlier, I just found out about the PD plus access for coaches for registered teams about two weeks ago, which was two weeks before World.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
35,So really kind of useless as far as me being able to get in there and look at much before the end of the season.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
36,But it's something I'm definitely going to be looking at and utilizing going forward.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
37,It would have been nice to know about that a while ago.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
38,"So again, the newsletter being able to stay on top of all the latest and greatest announcements and also having a way to provide this type of feedback in the future.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
39,"I've had a couple of students come into the programming, into the robotics program, super excited and with one student in particular, it was just a bad experience.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
40,The state championship really turned them off to competitive robotics and I haven't seen him come back since.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
41,So having a way to really handle those sour experiences on the competitive side would definitely help out.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
42,"Again, I know this is educational educator focused, and I'm not an educator.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
43,I see it all the time.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
44,Referee making a bad call and the parents getting upset because there's no way for the parents to give feedback or anything like that.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
45,"Think that could be handled better from the competitive side, but not sure where best that feedback should go.","robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
46,Yeah.,"robotics coach Bel Air, CO"
